I really don't see the point anymore

I really feel like have no point on Earth anymore.I have family that loves me but thats sometimes not enough.No matter how hard I try I cant make friends.I have casual friends who I talk to sometimes but they never ask me to hang out and if I ask them they always say they're busy.I know my life really isn't that bad but that doesn't make it any less hard.Tbh if my family didn't care about me I would probably kill myself.I feel like I have a responsibility to keep my mom happy.If she gets to sad she'll try to kill herself like she did when I was 11.And my cousin whos really close to me has already lost 2 of his cousins on his side in the last 2 years.I dont want to make it harder for him.I just don't know what to do and I feel like I have no one.This is the first time I've ever opened up to anyone like this even my therapist I didn't really talk to.
