Suicide of a Monster

How do I even begin?

I’m preparing to kill myself. I am a monster, and I don’t think I can live with the terrible thoughts that I am afflicted with. I cannot stop them, and it requires all of my strength to avoid acting on them.

I am a pedophile.

Those words took me nearly an hour to write. I’ve never spoken them before. I’ve never even written them.

This is my deepest secret. I have never admitted it to everyone, and I’m prepared to take it to my grave.

I have never had any sort of sexual contact with a child. **I would rather die than hurt a child**.

That’s really the reason why I’m going to kill myself. I swore when I was a teenager that I would kill myself if I were ever in a position where I felt like I was risking my perfect control over my actions.

There’s not anyone in particular that I would abuse (this is not an emergency “suicide or abuse a chid” situation), but I don’t feel like I have the strength to continue suppressing my sexual desires. I am miserable, and this is the only end in sight.

So fuck it. I’m sorry – I wish with all my heart that I didn’t feel this way. I have prayed to have this sickness excised from my soul. Nothing’s worked, and I truly believe that some things are so evil that it’s worth dying to destroy them.

Thank you for reading this. You can’t possibly hate me more than I hate myself. Maybe I’ll see some of you in hell.
