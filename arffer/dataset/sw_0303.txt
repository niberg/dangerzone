I fear death

After my cancer scare 3 months ago, i think of death daily, it is something that is always on the back of my mind.I get sad knowing that i will die too soon and not experience technology in the next 50 years, see my children,experience some new mind blowing drugs.This has made me depressed but also grateful. Every time i am walking my dog at night i take a breath of the cold air and feel alive, i notice the beauty in flowers,how wonderful a sunset...etc. What i am trying to say is life is given once...now matter how bad it gets...you alone control your fate.In the face of darkness....see the light...here is my favorite poem you might know it already....it helps me get by

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul.
