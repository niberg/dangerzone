I don't know what to do

I'm male, and gay. Neither of which I've ever had a problem with. A year ago, I met a guy online on a fetish website. We met, and started hooking up. It was great. He wanted detached sex, and I was OK with that for a time. 4 months ago, I confessed to him that I was having deeper feelings for him. He cut me off. I spiraled into depression, something new for me. I tried to kill myself, and failed. Since then, he and I have started talking again, a bit, and I still love him. I love him with all my heart, and I know that's something that won't ever be returned. He's bisexual, and only fucks guys for fun. He has no interest in building anything more than that. He's since replaced me with two other guys he meets on a semi-regular basis. And even with all that, I cannot imagine being without him. I am scared to stop talking to him. I'm scared to try to date again because it means shutting that door - a door which I'm fully aware was never open in the first place.
My heart and my mind are at complete odds with each other. Rationally, I know the situation. Emotionally, I'm a wreck. The last two days, I've gone home and cried - also something new for me. I just can't take the pain of the rejection anymore. I'm still a functioning member of society. I take my dog to daycare, but otherwise he's ignored (fed every day, but otherwise ignored). I go to work, and drone away. The last 4 months of my life have been on auto-pilot, and I don't know how to break the cycle. Every 4 days or so, I plummet, and start contemplating suicide again, but I know I'm not brave enough to actually go through with it. I feel worthless without his affection and approval.
I just don't know what to do.
