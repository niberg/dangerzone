I want to die on my birthday..

I have been battling with depression for almost six years, with very little time without depression. In the last year, I have slowly lost all support I had holding me up. I spend a lot more of my time zoned out and feeling disconnnected from everyone. I have a girlfriend, but she is very materialistic and unsupportive. I don't have the finances to make her happy anymore. We fell in love very young, but as she grows older she has been transforming into the type of people I don't like. I have been battling health problems since I was thirteen, they never get better, but everyone around me pretends like they don't matter. Those health problems have given me great access to opiods, which I have always taken more than I need, just to feel warm. I miss three of my old friends, they were all females, but they were never anything more than friends. I never needed them to be anything more. I just enjoyed speaking to them. They have all left my life, I don't know why either. I always reached out to talk to them to talk; they never really reached out to me. I started off testing them to see if they ever would reach out to me. Two years later, they haven't. How can you go from skyping someone daily, to not even caring if they are alive? I work a horrible job at a supermarket during second shift. My coworkers don't help me, but they help eachother. I get along with my bosses, but I think they are just playing nice to get another grunt to do all the hard work. I just wish someone in this world would like to talk to me with no strings attached. I wish someone would actually miss me when I disappear. My birthday is coming up in a couple weeks, I have always felt like it would be a nice day to end it. I've been holding on for too long, I am on empty.
