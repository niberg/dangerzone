Stop being a little bitch. You little bitch.

Seriously shut the fuck up. Don't bring you issues to work. you have a fucking job to do so get it done. Nobody in the office gives a single fuck that you're gay. That's not a reason to act like a bitch and not do your job. If you have a real problem then find some damn help and get that shit fixed but if the simple fact that you're gay is going to stop you from getting shit done maybe you should find a new job. I got kids fresh out of college who would love to work here and here you are bitching and whining. Take that pride shit somewhere else. 
We don't hate you and nobody said anything about you... But we're on the ledge now. We didn't give a fuck about your orientation or sexuality  or whatever the fuck you call it or call yourself. Get your shit together and stop being a bitch. You're a man so I'll treat you like one but the moment you start being a little bitch again I'll be looking through applications and emails to fill in your spot. Fuck!

Came back to Rant. Didn't rant the other day about another subject.
