hi

Im very sad. I have tried to broken up with my abusive SO, but he wont leave. I have a crush on my closest friend, who I always talk to with when Im sad, but he is not interested in anything more. I feel very lonely, but I dont know where to turn. I cant give up my job and move away as its my first job and Im very unlikely to get one anywhere else. Im stuck in the same apartment as him. it feels like I dont have any options. I just wished I could marry off to someone far away and he would take care of me and we would live happy ever after. But thats not something I shouldl search for now, I should just search for self care and improve myslef, i dont want to wish this upon someone else. I just wished I had someone. Instead of being in care when I was younger i turned homeless, and I miss it now. I could be sit under a bridge without any responsibilities and just be left alone. Hunger and cold has nothing on heart break and betrayal. I wish I could get far away, I hope there is aheaven but there isnt. Instead there are more years with more hardship and people say that what doesnt kill you make you stronger bu I dont feel stronger, I feel weaker for every thing and I feel as it kills me, but its too slow and I want to end it now
