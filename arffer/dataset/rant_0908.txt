Parents: You're NOT always right

While you do have many more years under your belt than your children that does **not** mean you are always right. You may have gone through a similar situation to your child *but you're not in their shoes*, and they're their own person, therefore they're experience is *not yours*. Try being empathetic and listening instead of shoving unsolicited advice down their throat. **Stop thinking that you're always right!** ... especially when your "child" is an adult, when they have the mental capacity to distinguish between right and wrong, make their own decisions and suffer the consequences of their actions/inactions. It's not up to you to have the "perfect child" because they have the right to make an identity for themselves. **stop telling them what to do and just let them do as they will**. Sure, they may make a bad decision but *they're human*. The best lessons learned are ones learned firsthand, so stop trying to shove unwarranted counsel down their throat.
