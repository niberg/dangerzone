I am so sick of these "healthy" foods tasting like shit.

Fuck those microwave meals. Fuck Healthy Choice and their stupid tasteless cardboard they call "food." And fuck my step dad for not monitoring his blood sugar at all these past few years and forcing us to eat this "food." I can't fucking eat anything except flash frozen vegetables because that's all he can eat. I'm sick of being so poor that all we can afford are the same meals for us all. I can't even eat fresh fruit or veggies because we can only afford frozen shit. I'm so hungry right now but I don't want any tasteless fuck. I feel so unfulfilled and still hungry by the end of the meal. But hey, at least my step dad gets to have a good amount of sugar in his blood!

I couldn't care less about fast food or candy. All I want is to compromise and eat something fresh and fulfilling. The yard is too small and neighborhood too rude and invasive for a garden, our food stamps barely feed us through the month, and the only thing my fucking step dad can eat to keep his fucking blood sugar down are those fucking disgusting meals I've been eating morning, noon, and night. I hate this so fucking much.
