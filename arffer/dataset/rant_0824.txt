Don't touch my charger.

I know they are mostly the same.  One is an LG charger and one is a Sony charger.  But why the  Fuck do you find it necessary  to switch my charger with yours? I'm trying to go to bed, but after  turning around and seeing the bold Sony text on the charger, I couldn't even close my eyes. I know it's just a wire, but it's my fucking wire! I'll probably be awake for the rest of the night thinking about what you did. I won't even be able to get my charger in the morning because I have to leave, and now every time I plug my phone in, I will constantly be reminded of the atrocity you committed!
