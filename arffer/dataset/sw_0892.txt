I've been trying

Tonight was my 4th encounter with suicide. It's been getting progressively worse. A couple of months back I just tied my bedsheets around my neck because I wanted to see how it looked. It really scared me but i kept going. A couple of weeks ago i tried to tape the bedsheets to my ceiling to see how I would look hanging. And now tonight I tried to do it for real, except I wanted to keep a stepstool below me so I could opt out if I wanted to. I'm afraid that one day I'll do it and regret it, but right now I don't think I'll regret it. Everyone I know is out on Halloween and I didn't get a single invite. I've never had a girlfriend before, and I don't really have any friends. Most of my family annoys me and I want to move away as soon as possible
