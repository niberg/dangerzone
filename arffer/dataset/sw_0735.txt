I want to die

My life is slipping, my relationship with my girlfriend has been horribly rocky, I can't get over my past, I smoke away my problems, I feel like my closest of friends are burdened by me, I haven't been sleeping or eating, and I can't escape much I want to die.

The lists of reasons to die have exceeded the list of reasons to live.

I'll elaborate more with comments.
