I don't know how to kill myself

This is not a thread for you to tell me not to kill myself . I'm not changing my mind. 

I keep moving from shit job to shit job, never more than 10 dollars an hour. My social skills are shit and I can't talk to women or even men effectively. I have always had low energy and some people may consider me slow in a lot of everyday aspects but I have done some cool stuff before. I'm a 19 year old virgin making 7.25 an hour with a max of 25 hours a week. Nobody gives a fuckup about me. This girl at work has the biggest fattest ass and I would do anything to hit it but I don't think that is ever going to happen. 

I'm pretty much a failure in every aspect of life and I'm not even sure I can succeed in killing myself. Is there a public service that will help me by giving me cyanide or something?
