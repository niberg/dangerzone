Men wearing obvious lipstick on TV and movies. Why can't makeup people get it right?

I used to notice this problem in movies that take place in dark / blue lighting.  Now I see it on popular TV shows everywhere.  I understand the need for stage makeup but should the mens lip color match the womans in the same scene?
