My mental health treatment isn't helping.

I was diagnosed with Aspergers Disorder at an early age.  For my entire life I had hardly any ability to socialize with others.  Because of this and other reasons, I have always felt alone and worthless.  I have been in and out of therapy for as long as I can remember and 7 months ago I was placed in a mental hospital for suicidal depression. I was released but I am starting to feel depressed again and if it gets to that point I don't want to go back to that god awful hospital.  I feel like if I end up back in the hospital all the progress I made over the last few months will be for nothing.  I don't want to live with the shame of being dependent on therapy and medicine to function normally.
