I'm not having a good time

So I'm having a rough time lately. Long story short, my parents are giving me major anxiety, I feel like my closest friends are pushing me away, and an activity that was a big part of my life has just ended after almost 6 years of attending weekly. I feel lost. These reasons, plus pressures of being a uni student now and worried about my future has lead me to some really bad thoughts lately. 

I keep feeling that ending it would be preferable to the burdens of life. I don't think I would ever have the guts to do anything but... I'm not sure. 

I feel like I've got nothing and no one in my life and I'm really scared.
