I honestly just want to end it all

I honestly want to end my life right now, I'm not asking for you to feel bad for me in any way. I just want to know if there is a reason for me to not do so. 
This summer I wrote a letter to my parents as I was so sure I was going to end it all, but I didn't for some reason.
This year has been extremely eventful after I chose not to take away my life. 
But today I couldn't help feel the same as I felt before. 
I have no future, I am honestly worthless and just a bother to my parents financially and mentally. 
The future scares me so much, and there has been so much pressure deciding what to become, where to go to university (I'm in the last year of High School).
I have been trying to brush off this feeling for a while, but its all coming back.
