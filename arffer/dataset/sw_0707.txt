I don't want to live like this anymore. Or at all.

I having been struggling a lot lately. I have no motivation to get out of bed. I'm so tired all the time, but can't sleep well at night. I have nightmares of dying. I'm in so much pain, emotionally and physically. I'm constantly sick, making it hard to do daily tasks. I can't talk to anyone because I don't have anyone who understands. I'm so lonely, and for the first time in a long time I'm scared both for and of myself.
