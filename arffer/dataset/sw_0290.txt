Things change but stay the same

A year ago I made a pact with myself. That if things didn't get better I would end myself. My situation has changed gotten better in some places but much much worse in others. The world is a deep dark disgusting place that I want no part of. I've written my note I have the place and a 38 special. If things work out by around 2 tomorrow I will no longer be here. I'm not sure why I'm writing with honestly. Maybe its I want to be talked out of it. Maybe its a final goodbye to the internet. That I've spent most of my life on trying to escape reality. Or its just I'm just doing it because it popped in my head. Either way this is it
