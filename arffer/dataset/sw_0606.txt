I let people decide.

Today I sat down telling myself that I'm going to kill myself soon if not a single person is going to try to contact me before 12 am. People like to tell you that whatever higher power would send you signs to help you decide about important stuff like that, right?

I had written a couple of posts in places where I was sure people that could possibly still care about me would see that I'm pretty desperate of help right and maybe get the hint that I needed someone. You know, those people that tell you you shouldn't kill yourself because "they care" or stuff like that. 

It's past 12 am.
No one even bothered asking if I'm alright.

Well, I wanted help making my decision. I guess here's my answer.
