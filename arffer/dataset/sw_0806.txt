Huh.

I had a strange moment about a month ago. I've been worried about his friend of mine for a while. He'd make these jokes about suicide every now and again, and I always thought looking back on them that he was reaching out for somebody. I'm not great socially and it was a particularly awkward subject, so after getting slightly drunk with him and a few other friends I said outright that I was worried about him. The answer I got shocked me.

I was expecting him to open up, let out his demons, have a nice deep meaningful conversation, you know the usual cliche shit.

He said he was fine.

In fact he said he'd other people who had been worried too and he'd gone to a shrink. He'd been told he was fine, and given he was drunk, and we're really close friends, I believe him.

I'm kind of pissed off about that to tell you the truth. I'm not angry at him at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy he's doing ok. But I'd been hoping for a while that I'd be able to do some rebound therapy with him given we have situations going on in the background that are very similar.

You see I've never felt comfortable saying that there's something legitimately wrong here. I don't think I have the full distilled depression, but I do find myself feeling sad and tired for no reason. And it would have been a textbook way of sorting my shit out. Get comfortable, open up to somebody close to you who can empathise. But that won't fucking work anymore.

It's kind of funny when I think about it, can't really put my finger on why that is.
