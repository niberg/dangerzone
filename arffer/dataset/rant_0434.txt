Why people hate Zoella

Right, I'm gunna say this for the last f-cking time. Zoella is annoying, regardless of how much you watch her but the bloody Darling and the face of British Vlogging irritates me so much, being a fan of the King of the UK YouTube scene 'King Tom Syndicate' and yet every year the Teen Awards pop up and all Zoella cares about is showing off and paying YouTube to make a montage all about her to hypnotise us into voting her. Whatever we do we can vote for Syndicate or other vloggers and since Zoella has so much left over revenue money from YT she basically buys the f-cking award from the sh-tting BBC events producer saying "I'll suck your penises and I'll give you Â£2000 if you let me win the award!" EVERY BLOODY YEAR!
Zoella please quit YT and get a real f-cking job and get outside and earn real money like the rest of us in society you money laundering sl-t
