If I kill myself, will my wife inherit my debts?

Simple question, I hope people around here will know than answer.  I'm British and I've got a few debts in my name (nothing joint) less than Â£4000, nothing big but I don't want to pass this onto my wife when I die.

I don't want counseling, I don't want help, this is going to happen.  Money is not the reason for this, my debts are easily payable, I simply have a deep seeded desire not to live, I didn't ask for this and I certainly don't want it.  I just want to know that I won't be burdening my wife and daughter with this money when I go.

Thanks.
