Afrocentric Annie

The movie industry is releasing a new 'black-centric' Annie film soon and it pisses me off. Basically you want to tell me that Annie isn't approachable for black kids in its original form, and so we had to make it reflect a more relatable character to black society.

What kind of shallow, divisive, racist moral is that teaching our children, when you tell they need to look like a character to empathize or sympathize with what they dealt with? It's like "Oh, hey, I know you like Annie but she's white, so that's not something you connect with." 

I enjoyed a fantastic anime film about a woman caught in battle against sentient A.I. and, sometimes,  that's how I feel about Siri. Hopefully they release a white male American remake of this film asap so I get the chance to relate to it though, right?

And really, Jamie Foxx et al? Casting Miss Hannigan as white after all of the Other changes to cast race? Tasteless.
