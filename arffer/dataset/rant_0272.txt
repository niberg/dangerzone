Bored waiting in airport gate

sitting in IAD waiting for my 9 hour flight back to the UK. There is a big glowing green clock infront of me, reminding me of the excruciatingly slow passage of time in case I forget how long I gotta sit here. There is some real bad instrumental jazz playing. The people around me look like death. I probably look like death too. There is a dingy overpriced airport bar but it's full. There are regular announcements in what I believe to be an Indian accent, but they are mostly unintelligible, yet simultaneously important sounding. "Blarpmerpmerp static blatp security blatp important static mmfffff fbsjdbdbd unattended fffrrl passenger static attention please ghdjchdn thank you".

Also I am acutely conscious that probably look like a gay hipster attempting to write a novel where people can see him, sitting here tapping this out on my ipad.
