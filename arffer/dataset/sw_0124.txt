I'm so incredibly ashamed of myself...

Last weekend, while incredibly drunk with my girlfriend, I got into a huge shouting match with her, and for a few seconds I put my hands to her throat. I stopped very quickly and she was not injured. But she was terrified. This woman I love is terrified of me. I don't expect I'll ever see her again. Or hear her speak my name sweetly. I just want to hold her in my arms and comfort her but I am the problem. 
Since then I can barely look at myself in the mirror. Last night I was walking across the Burrard street bridge and I spent a good twenty minutes staring down at the water below. I don't know if I can forgive myself for this, but I don't want to cause anyone, especially her, anymore pain by putting them through my funeral. But I honestly don't know how to go on. Please. Tell me what to do. 
Her neighbour called the cops too, and I am facing charges. This doesn't really bother me because I know I deserve it. But I'm not allowed to contact her at all and that is eating me up inside. I just want to hear her voice again. But maybe I never will.
