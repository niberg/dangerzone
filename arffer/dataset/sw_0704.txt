I don't know what to do

I don't want to keep going. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live. I just want everything to stop. I wish I could sleep forever.
I know that I am a bad person. I hurt everyone who loves me.
I hate my body. I hate all these horrible self-pitying thoughts that I can't stop.
I know that I am responsible for all my problems. I think I am doing this to myself. All these thoughts and feelings. 
I just can't stand it. I think about killing myself, and I think I might do it. I just want to stop being stressed and scared and stop this constant failure.

I don't know what to do.
