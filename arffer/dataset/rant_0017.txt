Get off your goddamned high horse!!!!!

I work 3rd shift and every other person in my life works 1st or doesnt work at all. They have no freaking clue how hard it can be to do things during the day. 

My sis-in-law fell ill a week or so ago. They didnt even tell me, I read about it on facebook 7 hrs after the fact. I immediately started calling and texting them to see everything was ok, still didnt get a complete answer for another 2 days. I brought up coming to visit twice, but both times was told it wasnt a good time or that she was sleeping.

Now, when Im trying to talk to her, shes all fucking pissy that I havent come to visit saying "We have no family that fucking cares and Im done asking". Well to hell with you too! Im sorry, but I work a completely opposite shift from you and get out of work after youve left for work, and I live 45 minutes away. I cant just come over anytime its convenient for you. Also, I still havent forgotten the time you kicked me out of OUR MOTHERS house on Thanksgiving as I was babysitting your son because you thought my charging my laptop and taking showers there was the reason you couldnt give your 10 year old an Xbox AND a new laptop that year. Fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkkkkkkk.
