She's back with her fucking ex as of yesterday. I don't know why the fuck she liked toying with me the whole time, but I can't believe I fell for it. I should've known I'm not a lovable person. What's the point of living if I'm not wanted?

Right after graduation, I'm making it look like an accident.
