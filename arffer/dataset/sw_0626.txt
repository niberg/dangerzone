I don't think I like being human and possibly sometimes alive.

Human behavior makes me sick. Most forms of it. Lots of it is beautiful, and I get that, but the overall experience, "the ride", is draining and I can't figure out if it's worth it or not. 

I don't often feel human. Is there a name for this feeling? I don't feel like I belong, like I don't get it. Maybe I'm just particularly tired today. Every interaction comes with an involuntary sigh.
