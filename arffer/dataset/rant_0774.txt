It stupefies me how moronic we are. (Ebola rant)

Let's begin by saying Ebola would have A. Never came to America in the first place, or B. Came to america at a much slower rate to which we could have prepared for an outbreak. But no, Thomas Eric Duncan just wouldn't have that. I know someone's going to call me out on how much I suck for saying this and tell me to get into his shoes and see things from his perspective, but I'm sorry. I see no justification for lying on a disease screening sheet about not possessing any fatal (incurable, highly contagious, etc.) diseases such as Ebola, and taking that disease to us where we lack the resources to properly treat it. I know he probably had a reason other than *Bioterrorism,* but I couldn't care less. He just infected an entire country, and unless we find a cure or at least a way to suppress Ebola within the next two months, it will become an insurmountable foe. So I couldn't care less about what possible reason he could've had to justify this. 

Now people are walking around, joking about Ebola. People pretending to have Ebola, people making jokes about Ebola in general. I find that to be hideous behavior, no one should joke about an inevitably fatal disease. Ever. 

Rant over.
