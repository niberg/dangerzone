Scared of myself..

I am so scared of myself right now. I still haven't done "it", and people say that that is brave, but it really isn't. I just haven't got the balls yet. And I'm in my bleak, dark, black hole. I'm afraid that I will take another overdose and succeed this time. I'm so afraid. I can't tell anyone. I can't.
