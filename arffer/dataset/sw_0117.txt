Had a perfect life and ruined it

I had the perfect life.  Great wife and two smart amazing kids.  I decided that I wanted to fool around with a girl who charges for such things and probably have contracted an STD.  I'm waiting for the results to come back, but the slight burning tells me I have a problem.  
  
How on earth will I explain this to my wife?  We haven't been on stellar terms lately, and I feel this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  If I have done anything to hurt her or given her an STD (yes we have been together since this incident - one time), I will never forgive myself, let alone the small chance that she will forgive me.  
  
As you can tell from what I've written here, I *actually* deserve to die.  A selfish POS like me has no reason to exist and if the results come back the way I think they will, I won't exist any longer.    
  
I have no idea what I was thinking when I went through with this escapade, but it will be my final mistake.  I will come clean to my wife at such time, she will throw me out, I won't be able to see my beautiful kids anymore, and that's it for me.  
  
I can't live without my family.  There is no reason to go on.    
  
I'm not looking for sympathy, but possibly a way out.  I feel horrible and ashamed.  I hate myself so much, that I'm consumed with trying to figure a way out of this world.
