Is anyone else sick of percieved religeous stereotypes?

When I grow my beard to a respectable amount, it never fails that I get called out for looking like a muslim, not that its a bad thing to "look" like a muslim. But it always makes me think, why a muslim? Why not a pagan viking (since I´m a scandinavian) or maybe a jew (I´ve once been called out on that, much to my surprise and enjoyment), or hindu. Why the fuck does my appearance make me look like a religous follower of islam all of a sudden? Would I be considered a buddisth if I´d shave my head?

Is society that shallow, that we need to look the part to be able to be considered a respectable follower of a certain religion. Is this just a accompaniment of modern western cultural perception or has it been this way for a long time? Because I wonder how the stereotype for muslims perceiving christians, protestants or chatolics is, if there is any. 

I´m sick and tired of having my beard associated with being a religious follower, its not that uncommon for a male of any race to grow a beard, nota bene.
