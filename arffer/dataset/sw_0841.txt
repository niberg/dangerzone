just need to talk

So, I'm not quite sure how to even start one of these posts...I guess I'll just jump right in. I'm 23 years old and I feel empty. I should point out that I have never seriously considered offing myself, but I do spend a considerable amount of time thinking about it. I wish I could say I have some horrible back story because then at least I could have something concrete to point to as to why I feel this way. I don't though....I have a loving family, a steady job, and what most would consider a pretty normal life.

But all I can ever think about is how pointless this all is. Death is certain for all, so what exactly is the point of living? I mean, everything just seems so unnecessary. I spend 5-6 days a week at the gym trying to lose weight so that women will actually be attracted to me, I go to work to make money to pay for things like my loans and bills, and I only socialize with people these days just as a distraction from my own thoughts. 

I'm sure this just sounds whiny and pessimistic, and it probably is, but I just don't see a point in keeping this up. Thanks to those of you who read this, it was nice to let off some steam.
