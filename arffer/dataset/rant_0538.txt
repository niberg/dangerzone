no, your ex-wife does not get to decorate

I've always been very inclusive, and accepting of my husband ex's.  (yes that's plural)  Two ex-wives, with 1 child each.   We have worked them into our lives, because I truly believe that the connection between child and dad should not be strained because I came into the picture.  At this time, we have been married 10 years and been together longer than that.  The two kids, are 32, and 22 respectively.  Both have graced us with grandchildren this year, and I have my own 34 year old with a 4 yr old granddaughter.  Today, I come home, and ex-wife #2 has delivered one of those multiple frames with pics of two of the grandkids in each of the 6 places, but nowhere for the third, older granddaughter.  I don't want this on my wall!  I don't want to have to explain why my first grandchild is not in it, and it's not how I want to decorate with pics of the grandkids.  I want all the pictures going forward in digital format. (to run on the new fangled smart tv's)  Not picture frames, not on the wall that I have to remove something to put this monstrosity up.  I told hubby, that it goes in the mancave, or nowhere.  Not even playing, it's my house not yours!
