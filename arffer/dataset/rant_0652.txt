I'm not obsessed with you!

But I know why you feel that way, so allow me to explain:

I'm interested in having a relationship, not being your friend, I can't even think of you as a friend. The option for us to be 'just friends' doesn't exist. Whenever we hang out all I'm looking for is an indication of whether a relationship is imminent or if I'm better off cutting ties and moving on. 

So we'll be acting like friends when you start indicating that's not all you have in mind. I hesitate, because this has all happened before. You'll persist, I'll let my guard down, and the rest of the time we're together will feel like a date. Until the inevitable point when you remind me you're not interested at all, and MY advances are making YOU uncomfortable. I'll end up angry, being baited and switched and all, but you'll just think it's me being batshit crazy. Afterwards while I'm in the process of getting over you we'll reconcile and it'll start all over again. 

I'm not obsessed, just very frustrated at not knowing what to do. You're not a bad guy, and I don't believe you're taking advantage of me. Please, if you don't want me let me go, otherwise I'll wait for you. Just say something already.
