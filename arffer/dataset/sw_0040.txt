Hey it's me again

If you don't remeber me I made a post like a week ago about my problems and now they are getting even worse. My mother isn't home right now so I feel like if I am going to do it is going to happen now. Alone. That's what my life is. I just got in a fight with my only friend and now i am completely alone. No dad to turn to.. My grades have been falling lately. Really badly to. I can't imagine the studying I would do for the mid terms haha. No girlfriend... Infact I just got rejected so badly. No response from 3 girls. No one likes talking me. I usually spend my whole day after school sleeping or weeping since I am usually alone. My mom is the only light in my life and the reason I haven't done it.i don't want to move out in 3 years. I would be even more alone. I can't do this anymore I'm supposed to be having the time of life right now. Hanging out with friends... Playing sports... Having a girl friend... Having good grades, none of that is mine. I'm generally liked at my school but I don't think anyone would care if I died... No one, infact the only person to text me today is my abusive dad who my mom left like 4 years ago. I hate my life. I think I'm going to do it reddit unfortunately I for have any belts to hang my self and my grandma is downstairs so it looks like the only way out for me is going to be bleach I heard it's not the best way to go but it's my only option thanks reddit for being the only person here for me when I needed them ❤️ good bye :)
