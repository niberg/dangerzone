You and your blame game.

You are by far the most insane ex I have ever had. I don't even know where these problems come from. It's obvious they were here before I came into the picture, but yet you still blame me for everything. I did nothing but support you while you tried to get your shit together. I took your pills, your blades, and yet you still struggled. So I supported you more and more. I supported you so much, that when you overdosed anyway, I felt it was my fault and since I was so busy supporting you, I could barely support myself. Then you decide to flip and say that it was all my fault. That somehow, I'm the reason you started overdosing again. I'm the reason you started self harming again. That's such bullshit. I did nothing to you. I did absolutely nothing besides give all my time writing long ass messages explaining why you shouldn't overdose or self harm anymore. Yet you always did anyway. And then you still. STILL. Had the fucking guts to blame me for it. I didn't even break things off with you because of this kinda stuff. I broke things off with you because of everything else you did to me. You were an awful girlfriend. You would always flirt with other guys, you would always talk about how some wanted to have sex with you, and you would always blame your insecurities on me. Yet you have the audacity to sit there, and say that you were the better one in our relationship. Fuck that. Instead of being thankful for everything I had done for you, you decided to blame me for everything wrong with you.
