"/s" is the equivalent of explaining your shitty joke that no one got

If you have to denote sarcasm, then your comment wasn't funny enough to be differentiated from some drooling idiot. Sarcasm inherently has the chance of being misinterpreted. If it's witty enough, then people will get it. A few people will miss out, but that's the risk you run with being sarcastic in real life. Any funny sarcasm totally loses its steam by appending "/s" to the end.
