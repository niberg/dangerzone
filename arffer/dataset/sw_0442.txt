Is anyone else suicidal because of money?

I'm 24 and have $270 to my name make like $25 a week and live with my granparents in Ecuador. 

I was homeless in the USA and am scared to death of going back to the streets I went through things I'll never forget. 

I moved to Ecuador where my relatives have businesses and I have a chance at a job. I'm currently studying and can't get a job because of scheduling so I just sell baked goods in the meantime. I have a chance of getting a job in the future here but I will probably just make $500 max a month working in a hot kitchen 200hrs a month (I'm studying culinary school because I've always worked in the food business). 

I always dreamed of having a good job and family by 30 but it's all but a dream now.

**Anyone else feel like they're suicidal because of money but would be happy if they could just be independent or not work like a slave all day?**
