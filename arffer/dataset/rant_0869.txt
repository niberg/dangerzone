you're dust in the wind and i dont need that shit around

I dont understand how someone i've been friends with for 11 years can just not give a shit when i one day decide i dont want to be her friend anymore? Like shit you told me everything (well actually you tell everyone all of your problems). Not wishing me a happy birthday on my 16th birthday really closed the deal. I can't imagine you ever actually liking me as a person anyhow. you told me (behind my back) to go to hell because i asked you why you arent eating your lunch? i know you dont have an eating problem you dramatic bitch, so i dont see the point. and then getting mad at someone for hiding my drink during lunch? like its no big deal, really its just a drink. 
I wish you werent included in so many of my childhood memories because my life would really be a lot better. When you went to guidance because the boy i liked friends gave me that stupid as fuck letter and then you didnt admit to going to guidance- which by the way didnt help shit- i should have dropped you. It shocking i mean i saw your name on the fucking paper i know you did it, and it caused a whole lot of awkward. he didnt do anything wrong, he was making a "joke" sure it wasnt funny and i still dont get what the joke is, but its not detention worthy. When I look back at the memories all i see is someone who told people secrets, you just cant keep your mouth shut, i see a drama queen who hates judgemental people but calls girls with short shorts sluts, i see someone who hates people for absolutely no reason, i see someone who is fake as fuck- you are. you make fun of maddie, isnt she your best friend who you can tell everything to? thats cute. You dont know how to stand up for yourself either, in reality i actually kind of feel bad for you. You're an awful person. I wish i never met you.
