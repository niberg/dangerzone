I always ruin my everything. I feel like I'm one big fuck up with no purpose.

Like the title says. I ruin everything I do and I have no purpose. If I dropped dead right now I don't know when anyone would find me. I have no impact on anyone or the world around me. If I'm gone nothing will change and no one will be affected. I want to die just so I can stop being such a monumental fuck up. But most of all I feel like I don't matter. I feel so insignificant and I don't know what I'm doing. It's like I'm walking around in a fog with no one and just waiting to die.
