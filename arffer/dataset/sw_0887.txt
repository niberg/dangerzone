Here comes another holiday where I'm by myself

I'm 22 and have never even felt the warm touch of a woman.  They don't give a fuck about me.  I've been alone from the day I was born.  My parents are distant from me.  I don't have any friends.  I don't enjoy life.  

I'm broke as fuck, can't move out of my parent's house.  I have work at 730 tomorrow morning.  I'm tired as fuck.  Women don't give a fuck about me.  I don't know how to just go up and talk to random women.  I'm a fucking social retard.  Even if a girl were to be crazy about me I'm sure I could find a way to fuck it all up. 

I can't drown my sorrow in booze or weed because both make me feel like shit.  Everytime I partake the only thing going through my mind is when will I sober up. 

To top it all off everyone I know is out doing some shit for halloween having a good time with friends.  I'm sure a shit load of people are out getting laid like it's no big fucking deal.
