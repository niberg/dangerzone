If I had known how miserable and pathetic my college experience would be back in high school, I would have pulled the trigger my senior year

I held on because I was a firm believer that it would get better. I mean, how could it have possibly gotten worse? I don't even feel human at this point honestly. I'm so damn detached from reality that I can't really focus on bettering myself, nor do I really care to. I just want to turn off.
