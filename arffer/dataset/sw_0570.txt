Why try to fight for life and get better if you hate yourself?

This is something I've been struggling with lately. I used to be a fighter, and think I was worth it. I mean, sure I hated myself, but I was always trying to get better. I always had fight in me, that was who I was.
I have reached a point where I want to give up everything. I don't want to try. I don't deserve to try. I AM receiving professional help that I know will help and save my life, but I am not committed to it anymore.
So my question is, how do you try to get better if you don't feel like you deserve it?
And I don't want to hear answers like "Just do it" or "If you give up nothing will get better" or "Do it for someone else" or things like "Find something to motivate you." 
I have thought about those things and heard them all, but none of them make any sense if you hate yourself and want to die. None of those things can apply if you feel, deep, deep, deep down that you deserve to be miserable. If someone is not willing to try to help themselves, then what is the point?
