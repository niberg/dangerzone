Fuck you.

I'm starting to hate my boyfriend. He's an overgrown man child who does nothing besides sit on his lazy ass in front of a fucking computer. Not just a couple hours and then move on to something else, no. Alllllll damn day. From the moment his beedy fucking eyes open, til the wee hours of the morning. I'm over it. I've tried fucking talking to him. Does it work? For a day. Then what do ya know? Right back in that fucking computer chair he goes. I'm fucking over this bullshit.
