Same Thing Every Day

Wake up. Go to school. Come home. Go to sleep. Repeat.


I am a 16 year old kid. I constantly and striving for something to change. I spend most of my free time, on here. I know i am able to change things, i just don't know how. I feel alone all the time, which is really shitty of me since i have a family who loves me and wants the best for me. I don't know what to do know. I care for 1 person, outside of my family, and I feel like she is the only person who cares for me. All of my ''friends'' put me down constantly, for my music taste, the way i dress, and even the car i drive. I don't understand the point anymore. Go to school, get good grades, get a job, make a living....... But for what? So i can die a death i knew i had coming for me? I just don't get the point. I know i am too young for you guys to consider my thoughts valid, (and will consider it angst) so I am not expecting you guys to have much to tell me.

Edit: May i also add that I struggle in social interactions. I make myself look like a dumbass in front of everyone, and stutter like a bitch, especially in front of girls i am attracted to,and even people i am not attracted to.
