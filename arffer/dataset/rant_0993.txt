I hate the "No More" ads

The ad has celebrities saying "no more looking away", "no more ignoring it", etc., but it seems to focus only on women victims. Men can be victims of domestic violence too, but that is not addressed. The media talks about how bad football players are while forgetting that Hope Solo is facing DV charges.
