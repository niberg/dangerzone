I'm at the end of my rope here

I used to be able to handle myself just fine. I started out mildly depressed and even when it began to escalate a year later, I was able to live my life fine for the most part. These days, though, I can hardly stand the sight of other people without feeling the need to escape to my room. Seeing everyone around me so happy just reminds me of how dead I feel inside. I don't want to see anyone, but I don't want to fail out of school. I don't want to live, but I can't bring myself to die. Why can't I be like them?
