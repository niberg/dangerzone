I've told everyone that I'm fine

and that my depression is getting better, when in fact all I want to do is die. I consider suicide every fucking day. Literally everyone thinks I'm completely happy. I can't tell them because then my mom will find out and she will be pissed. The only thing keeping me from offing myself is that I can't think of a way to do it that won't scar the people around me.
