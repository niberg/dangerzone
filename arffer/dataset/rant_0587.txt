Why in the everloving fuck are my student loan repayments so goddamned high?!

$270 fucking dollars per month. That pretty much assures I'll continue to live with my parents for a very long time. And I'm still job searching though I supposedly received a "marketable degree". I even went to one of the cheapest colleges in the country, and my parents were gracious/generous enough to pay for 2 years worth of tuition and yet it's still this high. My cell phone bill isn't even half that. It wouldn't be so bad if they started at say $100 or even $150 and then worked it's way up, but it seriously is this high already? So much for trying to save money.
