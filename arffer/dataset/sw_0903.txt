No money, no job, no friends, no point

i'm flat broke (i have $2 to my name). i've been living off of potatoes and flour for a few days now. i've been trying for MONTHS to get a job but nowhere will hire me because i'm a full-time student with fucked up hours. my parents refuse to offer me any assistance because we no longer have any kind of relationship. i've been living in this city for months now and i have nobody i could call a friend. i've had this weird rash thing growing under my arms and i woke up today and its all over my chest and i have a fever and a terrible cough. i know i need to go to the doctor but i only have $2 to my name

now i'm curled up in a ball thinking of reasons why i shouldn't just hang myself outside my window. give everyone on my street a real spooky halloween decoration. there's no reason to live anymore i literally have NOTHING and NOBODY and even if i do survive today i am broke and this close to being homeless. there's nothing i can do
