We're opening at 6 pm on Thanksgiving day?

I think it's time to quit retail. 

And shame on anyone who goes shopping on Thanksgiving day to support retailers doing this.

This is just ridiculous. Last year it was 8 pm, now it's 6 pm, before we know it Thanksgiving won't be a holiday at all. Retailers already go straight from selling Halloween items to selling Christmas items. I remember as a kid there were Thanksgiving themed decoration items, I haven't seen many now that I'm an adult.
