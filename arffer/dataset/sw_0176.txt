Pointless waste of space who ruins everyone's life?

Hey

I feel like I've completely fucked up my life and I have no idea what to do other than killing myself. I have no job, I live off my mom's money and I think I might be failing out of college. 

I can't get a job because I have no references, and I'm socially retarded so I don't interview well. But I've just been wasting my moms money for 2 years now and I feel horrible about it. 

So yeah.... I don't contribute anything of value to society and I don't have any friends who would miss me anyway :/
