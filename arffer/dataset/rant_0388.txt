Why the hell do animals cost so much?

I want to know why the hell pet food is so god damn expensive, it is a necessity. having pets isn't a hobby, it is parenthood. im so sick of paying $50 per small bag of cat food. it is good for them, why so expensive! why are some bugs so expensive! I want to give my geckos the best food I can, I pay $25 for bugs that will last me two weeks!
