Credit bureau doesn't understand 'electronic'

security freezes and lifts are free to consumers by law with a police report. the credit bureaus however do eveyrthing they fucking can to attrit the consumer from actually getting it free.  

"Yes sir, you have to mail us the police report". 

"I already gave you the police report number.  You know it's electronically filed.  Reverse these charges made to my account. "

"Yes sir, but in order to do the free security freeze you have to mail it to this address"

"SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY'S EXISTENT IS BASED AROUND ELECTRONIC DATA MINING BUT FOR ME TO GET THE FREE SECURITY FREEZE ALLOWED BY LAW I HAVE TO PHYSICALLY TRANSPORT DEAD TREE SHAVINGS TO YOU FUCK YOU ALL"
