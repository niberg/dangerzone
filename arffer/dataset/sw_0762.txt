Ready to die. I think.

Hello Reddit.
25. Male.
military veteran.
Ruined everytheverything in my life. So many people I've 
upset or hurt. I'm homeless because I didn't pay my rent.
I just. I'm drinking and I'm ready to jump in front
of a car after this bar.

But part of me wants to go to a hospital.
but would that do any good, really ?
