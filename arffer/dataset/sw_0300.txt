I don't want to wake up

I made a post a few days ago, but my depression has only gotten worse, the only thing I have to look forward to is my time in my room at night when I can just masturbate and go to sleep. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up because I'm too much of a coward to ever actually kill myself, lucky me I just get to become more and more depressed until maybe I will be desensitized to the idea of killing myself, or maybe I'll just become nothing. Trash on the side of the street. I don't know how to help myself, my only passion has been taken away from me and I have no way to get it back, I've been told by my own mother that I'm failure and I'll never amount to anything. I don't want to try anymore, I just want to be alone...or maybe I want someone to be with...I don't know. All I know is right now I have nobody...I wish I could just die. I'm just a failure anyway.
