My dad told me to kill myself

Ive been struggling with depression all my life which is only 14 years and now ive been pushed over the edge. Me and my dad got into an argument and said im a worthless peice of shit and he would give me up if he was allowed too. He took away everything i own including the only thing keeping me stable which is snowboarding. Then he told me to kill myself, goodbye reddit
