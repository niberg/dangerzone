I need to talk to someone. Urgent

I'm at the end of my rope. My life has dug itself to deep to get out alone. I've tried therapy, medication. Nothing works nobody takes me seriously. I need to talk to someone. I don't need anyone to talk me out of it. I understand the consequences, I honestly do. I just need to talk. Please, anyone.
