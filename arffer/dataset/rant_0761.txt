Tricare Young Adult Prime, I have something to say to you!

How hard is it for a monthly payment, done automatically and electronically, to come out on the same fucking day ever month?! Sometimes it's the 4th, or the 6th, or the 11th, I never know when you're going to take your $180, so in October, on the 2nd, I had just a couple bucks less in my checking account, so randomly THAT'S the day you want to take out your money? So now I owe the $180 and a $20 late fee? If you had taken your payment on the 3rd, you know, FRIDAY, you know, PAY DAY, then the money woulda been there, geeee, wow, thanks guys.
