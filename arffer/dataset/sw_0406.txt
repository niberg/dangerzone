I will kill myself. I just don't know when.

It's 2am and I'm having one of those mental breakdowns, right know. No metter what I'll do in my life I will be alone anyway. There won't be a miracle. It's not a movie, there won't be happy ending. I'm such a fucked up person. I will never be normal and have normal life. I can end it up quickly or suffer even more and then do this. But i can't run away from it.
