Idiot bitch.

As I was exiting a building, I glanced back to see if anyone was following me, and that's when I saw her. So i waited a half a second out the building, holding the door open because I'm a decent human being and right as she gets to the frame, I let go and continue walking, thinking that she would then do the same for the people exiting behind her. Nope. She doesn't even reach for the door, assuming that I was just going to hold it open and wait for her to exit completely before letting go. Anyway, the door swings closed as she's exiting and hits her shoulder or something (I had already turned away) and she goes "Ow!! (sarcastically) Thanks for holding the door, asshole." I did hold the door for you, you stupid bitch! Why the fuck is it my fault that you expect people to hold a door open until you are out of the swinging-radius, god forbid you have to look up from your phone and *gasp* prop a door open as you exit?! I held the door ajar so you didn't have to open it completely. You ungrateful cunt.
