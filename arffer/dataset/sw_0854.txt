Funny story. Wanted to kill myself. Didn't work out.

Long story short. My girlfriend was using me for money. Now, I have no money, lost my job, no friends or family. So, I was like fuck it. I went out to get a payday loan so I could get some money, go to a range and then blow my brains out. Which, before I had thought about but then I was like well.. I don't want to do that because, well that'll affect the business. Maybe the people working there are having a rough time and barely making it, maybe the business is. And then by me going there and off'ing myself, it affects it so badly that it makes things considerably worse.

But I was like fuck it, I don't care anymore.

So I went out to get a payday loan... But I couldn't even get it. Cause I don't have a job anymore. LOL Also got denied unemployment, so ya. lol and there's a lot more to it than just those things I listed in the beginning, but I'm no one would really care anyway. Just thought I'd share cause its funny and just how my life's always been. xD  Bye!
