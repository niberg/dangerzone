I'm tired of seeing people wearing clothes related to comic book culture, and not knowing anything about it.

This has always been a huge peeve of mine. It irks me to the core when I see someone wearing one of those Marvel shirts that has a bunch of characters on it, and I'll simply say something like, "Oh, that's cool, Daredevil looks bad ass." Normally that's when the person wearing the shirt says, "WHO??" I feel that if you don't know who or what is being depicted on your shirt, especially if it's an icon that means so much to so many people, you shouldn't wear the shirt. Additionally, it saddens me to see that Marvel and DC are becoming trends. I used to get made fun of for idolizing Spider-Man and Colossus in elementary school, and now I'm in high school, where it's perfectly normal to have a Justice League backpack. All I can say is at least we still have Image Comics and Dark Horse (among others) to ourselves.
