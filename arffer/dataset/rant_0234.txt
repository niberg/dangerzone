Panic attacks are not the same as asthma attacks!

One is psychological that the person can treat without needing help, and the other requires urgent medical attention. Yes, it may feel like death is impending, but you won't die from having a panic attack. So if you need a bag to treat your breathing difficulties (heard this from a caller on a radio station) and if it's vertigo-induced (read this in the Metro newspaper today), you probably don't have asthma. Asthma attacks are far worse than panic attacks.
