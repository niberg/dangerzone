Nearly was run over about twenty minutes ago

I'm a little bit pissed off right now. I was walking, minding my own business, on the sidewalk, when I came up to an intersection. At this intersection, a calm residential road intersects with a fairly busy road, with no traffic lights. I was going to cross the non-busy residential road. As I approach the intersection, a driver in a Mercedes GL Class pulls up along the non-busy road, and stops by the stop sign, intending to turn right. I begin to cross the road, as pedestrians always have right of way in my jurisdiction, assuming that the driver has scanned for pedestrians, whom she must yield to. So I walk across the front of the car and have almost crossed when the driver begins to accelerate, with me still standing in front of the car, positioned directly in front of the driver (who should have seen me if she was paying any attention at all to what was directly in front of her).

If I had been

a) Elderly

b? Physically handicapped

c) Paying somewhat less than my full attention to the situation

I certainly would have been hit. While being hit by a large SUV still accelerating would likely not have severely injured me, I really cannot know how I would have faired. Had I been hit, I would have hit the car on the far left side of the grille, or the left headlight. In both cases, I would have been hit right in front of the driver and the left front tire.

I live in a Canadian city with about 170 000 people, and will I rarely encounter problems while walking about, incidents like this still occasionally happen and do not make me feel particularly safe.

Also, as a note to drivers, when you are entering a highway through and on ramp lane, please use your blinkers to indicate that you will be turning onto the ramp lane. As a pedestrian, should I need to cross a highway on ramp, I can only know if you intend to drive onto the highway if you indicate that you are doing so. This can make crossing a lot safer for me.
