i don't fucking care anymore

it keeps fucking happening. i feel OK for a little while and then i think about killing myself. i keep planning on it. i'm so tired of fucking doing this. i don't even know what i hope to gain from living.

i'm not even using a throwaway. earlier this year i went to a psych ward for a failed attempt. i can't sleep. every night i wake up every 2 hours. i have to listen to music or i hear voices. i struggle with an eating disorder. i have untreated PTSD and am possibly manic depressive. i don't know how i've held out this long, but i'm so tired of it. 

i'm never going to do the things i want to do or be who i want to be. i don't have any friends. my SO is fucking selfish to the point he gets more excited about a gig than a possible date with me. he's a fucking alcoholic. i don't know why i do this to myself. i just want to be held and feel like i'm needed, that i'm wanted around, that i'm important. but i'm not. i keep thinking about ways i can kill myself. 

i just can't. i don't want to go to class, i think i'm slipping into a depressive episode. i don't want to do anything anymore. i just want to starve myself until i die, or OD, anything. i don't see the point anymore. when i feel OK it's just temporary. i'm convinced that one day i'm going to end it for myself. the pain is too much and i hardly feel rested or worth it.
