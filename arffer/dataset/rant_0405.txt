My roommate is disrespectful and I can't say anything to her because she'll overreact.

Living in a college dorm, so I legit share a room with her. Right now she's blasting hip hop while dancing with a bunch of guys. The RA went to talk to her about the noise but they're friends, so he didn't do anything. I'm legit sitting in the cold lounge alone and crying because I can't sleep.

Tell her? And have her and all her friends give me the cold shoulder in my own room? Tell the RA who's not gonna do anything because they're friends? No thanks. I guess I'll wait here until I can use my own room.

I legit never do this. I never blast music. I never invite people over. And she always slams doors and drawers when I'm sleep. I make noise like a mouse. Mad quiet. And she walks like an elephant!! What did I do to deserve this shit.
