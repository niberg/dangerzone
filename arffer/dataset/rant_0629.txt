Hate my landlords answering machine

I rent a room, and my landlord has an answering machine for his phone. I can hear from it my room. Every single gosh darn time someone calls and it goes to voicemail, the person says "Hello? Hello? You there? You there? You there?" He didn't answer the phone I think you can assume he's not availible! It's very annoying to hear, especially with such consistency. Especially since if he doesn't answer it categorically means he's not there. I think it's the anticipation when I hear the phone ringing and know he's not there, I think oh Jesus here come a fucking parrot: "hello? Hello? Brawwwk...you there? You there? Brawwk! Hello?" Especially since a lot of the time the God damn message in its entirety: "hello? Hello? You there? Guess you're not there give me a call back." Aye yah I hate it so much.
