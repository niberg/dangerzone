I was interested in this girl, but F shes dumb, screw it!

During the summer, a group of friends invited me to join a hiking group, and **I met this girl Josy. I thought Josy was kinda cute,** and in the next few weeks I summed up some courage to chat her up on facebook. We exchange a few messages here and there, and we often hang out in group a so I was getting to know her more and more.

After years of hard work I get an acceptance letter to a masters program and she texts me with a big congratz. I don't normally get that so I was quite appreciative of the text and expressed it. She asked if I had any plans for celebration over the weekend, and I said no, so she invites me to hang out with two of her friends and a mutual friend of ours for dinner, and tells me I can bring my friends. Now being an introvert, I don't normally get invited out a lot so I was looking quite forward to it, and decided to invite a buddy of mine.

**We meet up at the restaurant and the friends show up. Guess what, they're two dudes. Our mutual friend, (female) friends show up and brings two other dudes. WOW WTF, a total sausage fest**. A table of 6 dudes, 2 girls. Her friends being guys, naturally weren't interested in talking to us let alone the fact that we don't even know each other, so you can just imagine how much awkwardness and segregated the conversations were going. Her attention was occupied by the guys, and me and my buddy were just twiddling our thumbs as if we were almost invisible.

I imagined her friends would be female which was the reason i brought my buddy, because no chick in their right mind would invite guys to meet guys, and given the circumstance, there isn't enough attention to go around to make us, the new newcomers, feel more comfortable.

**It gets worse. All of a sudden, 6 more guys fuckn show up. WOOOW WT actual F.** She had told one of her guy friends that he could invite some people, so he did, a group of 6 guys. seriously, what the hell was he thinking? What the hell was she thinking? This was going to be the most retarded day in my life ever. FORTUNATELY, the guys were smart enough to get their own table away from us. Had they sat down, it would've been completely retarded.

Me and my buddy make up an excuse to go to a friend of ours since we don't see him much, and she, with such a good judgement of the situation dared assert "or he can come here :D!" are you fuckn kidding me? do you not see the problem? how retarded this table is set up, and how awkward it is for us? WOW. 

I decline and a little later me and my buddy leave.

**Is it just me or does this girl have seriously low social intelligence. Any person with common sense would've known that this situation was going to be awkward right from the get go**, but then again, common sense isn't so common. I was expecting a person with an university education to have been more competant than this, but I guess not. I mean come on, if the roles were reversed, and I was out with four girls with a buddy, I wouldn't dare invite another two girls to come along and expect things to go smoothly.

**My conclusion: this girl is a dumbass and i'm never talking to her again. but i'm okay with it, found out the easy way.**
