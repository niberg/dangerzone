Deformed and seriously can't take it anymore

25M. I honestly can't take life anymore, especially when it is something I can't fix or control. I see fat people looking attractive after exercising or a skinny guy getting buffed after working out, but what about me? I have microcephaly, google search it and you'll see that I have an abnormally small head. It's something I can't fix no matter how hard I exercise or how rich I am. My quality of life is non-existent. I get stares no matter where I go and women constantly treat me like I'm some kind of stray dog. I feel inferior and PEOPLE treat me as inferior, just raw human nature at its best.

What's the point of living? I'll never get married and live a normal live like everyone else. I feel like everyone on this subreddit is probably normal looking and I'll do anything to have the issues they're having. Why live at all when no one respects you or even treat you as a human being? It's like living in a nazi concentration camp and having people constantly telling you that you're just depressed. Fuck this delusion. Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill myself right now, cause I can't see it.....
