Headline is a sale pitch, stupid.

Hello
So the thing is that I live with my landlady (I rent a room in the basement) and lately i've gotten myself in a situation where's i'm not employed and don't get any money for my next rent and stuff, which's no good but my lovely land lady (LLL) was more than willing to look over until my next paycheck. This in itself is well and good but lately she's been prone to bother me whenever she feels like it, aka any time of night and day, I sometimes have trouble sleeping and will be in my bed trying to sleep and suddenly hear the door's opening and she will be walking around and just sort of scooping about me and my space, and I don''t feel like I got a say in it because, just in a whim and I'll be out on the streets. Also i'm unemployed and i've applied for hundreds of jobs by now with no positive reception so my confidence isn't skyrocketing. I've begun to drink away alot of the small change that i borrow from my friends and I generally feel like a waste of space, It's not that I don't want to live, It's just that I can't take it much more, everyday is a live or die contemplation for me and I just feel helpless.
