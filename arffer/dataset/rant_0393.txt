my mother is more immature than my 8 month old neice

so one of my sisters is getting married on the weekend and alot of stuff has gone down but tldr my mother and most of that side of my family isnt invited to the reception. so this morning my mum rang me and "let slip" that my other sister was having dinner with a couple members of the extended family and acted like surprised cause i wasn't invited and all. so im kinda sure she told me about this dinner because i'm invited to the reception and she isn't but hey shes going to this kickass bbq at my drop kick sisters house...... i actually hate my family.
