Its a sick fucking world we live in

Isn't it? People that live to hurt others, lovers that use and abuse and leave hanging to just move on to the next person, people that live to feed of the sucsess of others, even the sucsessful that get to where they are by putting their own kind into the ground.  A world of social status, greed, judgement.  Where is the humanity anymore? Where is the fucking neighborly kindness, where people who ask how you are doing actually mean it and want to know? Its a sick fucking world, a disgusting world with so much hate and corruption that always over powers the "weak" kindness except for in fairy tales. Social labels determine how people are treated and how others behave. Soon I will get the balls to leave this wretched place, as the only thing that is keeping me here is so I don't leave my family in this god forsaken place alone.
