Don't be surprised if you're in the same place you are now, in 5 years!

I can't stand when you try to help someone who says they want help but they don't take your advice.  My friend is complaining about her "fianc√©" who does drugs, sells them out of her HER house, doesn't work, is a felon, is a master manipulator, they don't even have sex anymore.  She says "I know I don't want to marry him now" and when I push her to talk to him about it, she shuts down.  She claims she wants to do one thing, but won't stick up for herself.  I told her you'll be in the same spot in 5 years if you let him continue to manipulate you!  Don't complain to me about him and want my help, but won't tell him how you feel.  I can't do it for you!!!  Grow some balls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Yes, I know it's not easy.  Not looking for advice.  Not my life, gotta let it go.  Just hate to see her be held back.
