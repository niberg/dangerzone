My Little 11 Year Old Brother Is An Ungrateful Asshole

I love him, but he is the definition of an ungrateful brat. He's 11 but acts like he's 9 most of the time. Right now, it's just me, my mom, and my 4 year old brother living together and my mom and I let him play video games a lot but when things don't go his way, he fucking gives a fit! I told him "at 9am, turn off the game" and he says "But im in the middle of a battle (In GTA V)" so I say "Ok, after that game" and I leave him alone for a while. He goes onto play more games and when I asked him if he finished his original game, the motherfucker lies right in my fuckin face! Then I ask him if he's taken a shower and brushed his teeth yet and he LIES AGAIN. I know he's lying because I heard him in the morning wake up and gp straight to the PS3. He is so ungrateful! We're not rich by any means but we're lucky enough to have family members who help us get a 50in flat screen so we can play our PS3 (Which another uncle bought us for christmas a while back) in HD. He gets to spend all weekend lying around doing nothing but complains when he has to do chores or help my mom cook. He thinks the world is out to get him and says fairly frequently that he "Hates everybody" or that "I ALWAYS DO THE DISHES!!!" (Which isn't true at all). I'm just so tired of it and I know my mom is too; She works hard and has to deal with this shit? WHY!? I know that MAYBE someday he'll mature but waiting for that day is excruciating. Thanks for taking time to read this, I'm currently babysitting him and it's hell. What should I do about this shit?  

Oh yeah, his friend came over the other day and saw we had a PS3. He exclaimed "Wow! You guys have a PS3! My mom doesn't let me have any games" I thought that would knock some sense into my brother but nope.
