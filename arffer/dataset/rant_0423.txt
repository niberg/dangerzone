you and your stupid video game

We have gone over several times that I need to be shown affection in order to feel it. And you have promised you would never ignore me for any reason. Well I hate to break it to you, but you have just spent six fucking hours playing a fucking video game with your fucking earphones in, not even letting me lay my head against you. We were supposed to carve fucking pumpkins. And you've been "almost done" for two and a half fucking hours. I swear to fuckig God. I left my ex for this reason and I am not afraid to make another.
