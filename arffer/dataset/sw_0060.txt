Just so over it all. Don't want to but what the hell is stopping me? Fuck.

I should start off by saying that I have posted on here before, as someone offering support to another human contemplating suicide. 

I should also note that I am a counsellor and am studying psychology at college. I also have suffered from depression for 15 years.

I know this is crazy. I know I shouldn't be feeling this way. I really want to not necessarily die, but edge myself to death. With razor blades. And a noose.

I have had a traumatic past. More trauma than anyone should have to have gone through. I have tried to stay positive. I have tried therapy. I have tried drugs. This shit just won't go away.

I guess I was triggered tonight during an argument/discussion/talk with the bf. I don't/can't/won't ever trust anyone and I can't fucking deal with this any longer. I have attempted suicide before on two occasions. Both were unsuccessful due to lingering guilty feelings of how my Mother, Father, Sister and Brother would feel. I'm just at this point where I am saying fuck it.

I honestly think I am incapable of receiving love. I have felt this way for a long time. I give and give and give and life just shits on me. 

I feel like I could be a good person. Like I could be deserving of love and respect and affection but I just can't seem to find it. I fucking hate this.
