13 days til my 15th birthday

hey me again.... still not seeing a point in any of this. ever since high school started its just gotten worse. its like all structure in my life just broke. and I'm living in a state of nothingness. im just here. doing the same repetitive menial tasks that dont matter in the long haul... why should i even stay ugh
