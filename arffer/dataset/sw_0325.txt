I've lived through 16 years of pain.

I thought I would start this off by saying that in one month as of yesterday, I turn 16 years old.

My mother has a blood condition. I don't know that much about it, but what I do know is that it makes it so that she is extremely unenergetic; all she is capable of is sitting on a couch all day. She is a great person, but it's depressing not being able to do anything with her.

As for my dad, he has verbally abused me, and on a few occasions even physically abused me. Why he hates me so much, even though it was completely his choice to take me, I have no idea. (I am adopted, which is what I mean by it was his choice.)

I have a few friends at school - they laugh, I pretend to laugh, etc. None of them ever talk to me after school though. In fact, I have one SINGLE friend that talks to me at home, and he constantly says things to make me feel like I'm worse than he is.

I have been part of an online community for the last two years; it's been arguably the only thing that keeps me going. Or, at least, it WAS... until a little over half of a year ago. I had said something I meant to be taken casually, but the wording was misguided and therefore I became the most hated person in this community. (This is not an exxageration, either.)

The last 7 months or so after this incident have caused the worst depression of my entire life (and I have had several) and over this period, I have grown more and more suicidal. It's gotten to the point where recently, I almost did it. I had a knife in my hand, and the only things I could think of were what would happen if I jammed in through my throat.

I really have no reason, no genuine purpose to keep on going, and I really need help.
