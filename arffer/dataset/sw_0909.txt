How to lose everything in three days.

A month ago my life was perfect. I was living debt-free in a cabin with my fiancée of seven years. All of that is ruined. I had a mental breakdown, and was subsequently diagnosed with bipolar. Two days later, I was involuntarily committed to a psych ward. It fucked me up worse. Can't contact my ex fiancée because her mother is afraid of me, and so is she. I don't blame her. I blame myself. I'm back home at my mother's house, and under constant suicide watch. To top it off, somebody stole all of my medications while I was in the psych ward. The only thing I have done right for the past four years was remain medication-compliant, and now I can't even do that. 
Also, I was uninsured for the psych ward, and now am in debt $50,000+. 

Tonight, I'm going to kill myself. I'm finally unsupervised, and full of determination. I know the pain will finally stop. Plenty of resources at my disposal. 


To those with mental health issues, get help. Don't make the same decisions I did. It can get so much worse.
