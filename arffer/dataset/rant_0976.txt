Hey contractors: Got fuck all of yourselves

I am a homeowner. I purchased a modestly priced home that I planned on  renovating and upgrading over the years. First it was all brand new "premium" windows, from a well-known local contractor.  I caught the installers on several occasions cutting corners despite the supervisor I met with prior to the job assuring me that "these guys treat every job like their own house". Bullshit. If you find a rotten windowpane on your own house, you cut the fucking sill out and replace it. It is $2.59 for a 2x4 the last time I checked and would have been about 15-20 minutes of labor.  Then there was a new roof, aluminum trim, gutters, etc. Whatever retard nailed the fascia board up had to have felt the nail not go into the truss, but said "fuck it" the others will hold it up, and just left it. Also, lets use the absolute minimum number of nails we can get away with, to save the contractor $5.00 on the job.  This again, from a well-reviewed local company emphasizing "quality" above all-else. 

Then there was a recent job, where I had a new floor installed and and exterior door replaced. This retard took off the trim and showed me where the prior installer had failed to insulate it, explaining a draft. They even joked with me about it.  Well guess what. I took off the trim today just to fucking check, and lo and behold - no insulation. You probably thought I would never check, so figured you could save the $5.00 can of foam insulation.

You people can all go and fucking die. Did it ever occur to you that I would rehire you over and over and over if you just did a quality job? that I would rave about you to my friends and family, funneling additional business to you?  Is that $10 you saved on my job my skimping on screws and insulation worth it?

GO FUCKING DIE

Edit: so pissed I screwed up the title.
