I'm so fucking done

19 year old male here. Been fighting with suicidal thoughts on and off for about 4 years.
I still haven't done it because of the pain it'd bring to my family (I know that, my father killed himself when I was 14), but everyday, I'm becoming less and less sensitive.


First of all, I was born with a cleft lip (had all my surgeries) which makes me have a speech impediment very hard to deal with (even if it really slowly gets better with speech therapy). What's more I'm really ugly (legit ugly, not even Steve Buscemi level), I've been given shit for it and it haunts me to this day, when it has fully blown into a crippling social anxiety.


I'm tired of loneliness, even though I go to college almost every day (applied modern languages-like major), I still spend all weekends and downtime by myself. 


I don't feel like myself no more, I used to be  a carefree and fun-loving guy (even though still called out unattractive, dickface, and so on). I have passions and hobbies but most of them include lots of social interaction, and I'm so fuckin anxious of being made fun of. 
I ain't got no plans for my future, except maybe that I'd really like to do an ERASMUS exchange next year, but I'm worried that I'll be creepily social anxious, my roomates will ostracize me, that the year is awful and that I end up as lonely and shitty as now, or worse.


Sorry if that was too rambling, I have trouble getting it off my chest, and english isn't my native language.


UPDATE : Funny how the subconscious works, last night I dreamed of my father telling me something along the lines of "I sure care about you, too". Helps me stay grounded, at least for today.
