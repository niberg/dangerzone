I don't know if this is allowed but it's urgent. 13f friend messaged me talking about suicide. [Tips?]

So today one of my close friends began messaging me saying that her parents were gone and she was thinking about ending it. I just need help as to things to say, what not to do, etc. I really need her to be okay. Thank you in advanced.
