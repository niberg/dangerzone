"Mental Health Crisis"?

I'm not really sure what to do. I'd like to talk to some sort of medical professional or something on the phone. I've looked up suicide hotlines and "crisis" call centres online, but all the ones in my area seem to be closed right now, other than just calling 911 which I don't want to do.

I guess I'm asking if anyone has any advice on resources I could contact at 2AM? I'm in Nova Scotia Canada.

I just can't seem to find something that's in between someone calling the police to come get me because I'm endanger of self-harming and not doing anything at all. 

Any advice?
