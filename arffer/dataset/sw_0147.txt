I need some advice before I go insane.

So uh. From the beginning I guess. A couple months ago I met a guy. He was cute, we slept around, few days later I find out he has a gf. Well shit. Eventually he breaks up with her and we're still messing around and he's basically leading me on. He gets with another girl. He cheats on this girl also with me. I make him tell her and he does a bit because she makes him block me and stop talking to me. I talk to her and ask her to please let us be friends. Tell her all the truth. She's pissed but being chill and said she would tell him to talk to me. He said he would call me tomorrow before he goes over to her place. So she ends up blocking me for some reason. So now I'm thinking I'm not going to get to talk to him. 

He promised me he wouldn't do this. He swore he would be there for me. He told me he wasn't going to leave. He swore. And he did it. And I'm acheing. And I'm lost. And I'm mot sure what to do right now. 

I'm debating whether I should go to hi house sometime this week if he doesn't talk to me. Cause honestly I need to talk to him. 

Idk. What should I do guys, I'm really fucking lost. I'm aching, it's 5 am and I can't sleep. I'm crying. I want to go self harm. I want to go do stupid shit. I'm so confused.
