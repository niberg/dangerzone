Cannot eject iPod nano.

I hit the eject button in iTunes: "Cannot eject iPod because another program is using it." I look around in my programs - the only others are Photoshop and Finder, neither of which are using it. I try again: "Cannot eject iPod because another program is using it."

I go to Finder: "Cannot eject iPod because 'iTunes' is using it." I quit iTunes, which isn't using it at all, it's just an open program. I eject from Finder again, it ejects.

"Cannot eject from iTunes because iTunes is using it."

Thanks, Apple.
