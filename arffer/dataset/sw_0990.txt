I'm a failure, and I'm honestly to lazy to change that.

I'm 18 years old now. I've had suicidal tendencies probably since I was 13. I knew back then I was being highly irrational, I always came up with some reason of why I shouldn't namely being that I can turn it around. Right now my life is in deep shit, I don't see a solution.

I'm halfway through semester one of college. So far I have been getting shitty grades. I cannot focus, I even bought a ton of aderall, but it's to expensive to use all the time so I only use it for tests, so far my best score for an exam is an 80% and that is with drugs. I am to incapable to accomplish even with a handicap to help me focus.

I feel so isolated, When I was younger I had plenty of friends. By the time I left high school I really only had two friends. Once I got a girlfriend, she isolated me even further to the point I barely saw them.

Honestly I would never notice, but the thing that really kicks me when I am down is when anyone knocks on my door, 99.9% of the time it is for my roommate. the other .1% is my roommate, he forgot his room key. It also pisses me off so much when I get done studying at 2 a.m. to find a code on our door saying he is fucking a girl and I can't sleep.

I am still with her I honestly would like to say I HATE HER as a girlfriend at least. We have such different personalities we disagree on so much, we have about nothing in common. We can't even watch TV together. We honestly sit there and do nothing, and anytime I try to tell her this it's just another fight. We are also on very different levels of intelligence. She is in special education while I was taking honors classes 4 years ahead of her in math.

We have been together for one year, three months.

I honestly don't believe I have anything going for me, and I don't believe I could even put in the effort it would take to fix anything in my life.
