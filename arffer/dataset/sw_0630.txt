Why do I wish for my own death, but not others who are facing the same struggle?

I'll read people's posts here about their struggles, their failures, their wishes to die, and I can always relate. I've suffered from depression since the age of 12 and have attempted multiple times throughout my childhood. I still wish for my own death every day. However, I always find myself near tears for everyone here when I read their story, and even though I may not take the time to reply, inside i'm screaming for them not to give up. I want them to recover. I want encourage them that things will get better. But I stop myself from reaching out because I feel like a complete hypocrite. I can't help but wonder why I have more hope for everyone else but myself... is this a common thing?
