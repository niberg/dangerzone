Surround Sound Problem Forever!

It doesn't matter how many things I try or settings I change.  No matter how many times I read the user manual.  I have a 1000W Sony 5.1 surround. It even has a microphone that you set in the middle of the room and it automatically calibrates volume and speaker distance.  No matter what I do. It will blow the fucking windows out, BUT...can NEVER HEAR PEOPLE TALKING IN MOVIES!!  We can't just sit down and hit play. We have to use the remote to turn the volume up every time there is a scene went there is only talking.  And holy shit if the scene changes quickly to action.  Am I the only one??
