AT&amp;T

Compared to the other wireless services across America, the prices look decent in my area. That is until you actually start using it. Calls drop, sound quality is like the inside of a toilet bowl, and god forbid your phone breaks before the contract is up. They won't send you a brand new phone, but they won't even send you a replacement of the same make or price value. My phone came with a $300+ contract attached, and the power button no longer works. My replacement will likely be a refurbished, technically lower model which is the equivalent of a $250 contract.My phone didn't even last a year and I'm getting downgraded for it.

Luckily I don't use them for ISP, but my friend does, and he has dropouts every hour if he does anything as strenuous as a video game. How are these practices legal in this day and age.
