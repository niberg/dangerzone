A coworker is trying to take credit for my work.

A group of coworkers and myself set up a fundraiser at work to collect money for a non-profit. Basically we nominate coworkers, vote (putting money in a jar with their name), and the "winner" has to do something silly. All the nominees volunteered, all the money collected goes to the charity. 


Unbeknownst to me, someone else was planning something similar for a different charity, and when they saw my email, they thought/assumed that I was collecting money for the same charity. So they announced at a meeting that all the money collected from my event was going to Charity B. 


Without talking to me. Without asking. I sent him an email trying to figure out what happened, and we went back and forth for a bit until we figured out the mix up. I asked him to hold off on any more announcements until we could come up with a compromise. 


Not 5 minutes later he sends an email to the entire fucking office explaining that the money from this event is going to his charity and to please donate as much as possible. 


Dude, fuck you. 


Edit: I talked to him and worked something out. We're running the fundraiser for a few weeks. Mine has a strict deadline, so the money collected before that goes to mine, and he can keep it running after that for as long as he wants and those proceeds go to his charity.
