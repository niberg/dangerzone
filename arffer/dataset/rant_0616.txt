"Whatever"

There is nothing that enrages me, infuriates me, makes me want to curse you out or fucking strangle you more, than when we're having a serious discussion and when I make a point you answer it with "Whatever." 

**WHATEVER???**

Fuck you. There's so many things contained in that "Whatever" that maybe I'm reading too far into it but shit! You're being patronizing. It's short for "Whatever you say" and lazy for "I'm refusing to be mature enough to take your point seriously". You're being condescending. Remember when you asked your parents a question and they said "Because"? **BECAUSE WHAT??** you thought as a child, and now, you're making me feel like a child again, invalidating my personal feelings, my emotions and logic, because you can't muster up the effort to give me a straight answer. You're being *FUCKING RUDE*. You don't value me enough as your friend (and judging by how you act one of your only, probably your best) to be straight up and make your point, if you have one?? YOU'RE BEING A CHILD. You can't fucking buck up and approach this seriously?? **You're a grown woman**.

You don't know how hard I've fucking tried for you, tried and suffered and almost fucking **cried** for your unappreciative uncaring unable-to-deal-with-the-problem ass. I almost wish I didn't think it was worth the trouble. And that's what hurts the most. You've made me wish I didn't care. 

*Whatever.*
