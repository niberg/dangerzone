I'm planning to jump tomorrow morning

I'm planning to take a cab to the Golden Gate Bridge. My boyfriend broke up with me three weeks ago. I realized he's been seeing other women  since we broke up, and yesterday, he told me to leave so he could be with another girl. At the same time he tells me he doesn't want to be romantically involved any women he meets and he loves me. I can't take the two-facedness from someone I loved. I've been suicidal since last Sunday and I can't keep myself together any more.  I'm writing a suicide note to my parents explaining what happened and that it wasn't their fault and I love them.
