Public Restrooms

I'm sure this rant has probably happened here or somewhere similar before but seriously, FUCK PUBLIC WASHROOMS. 

Shitty toilets can be shitty. I'm a guy, so peeing is simple, I don't have to touch anything but my dank. But when I get to the sink, there had better be some goddamn soap in the soap dispenser. This room is a motherfucking petri dish of human filth and bacteria. All I want is soap and some water. I don't care if it's hot or cold. But please, please, for the sake of myself and the rest of the planet, let me wash my goddamn hands properly after I exit this germ-infested piss house. 

It's so simple. If you are responsible for a public restroom, shell out a little extra for extra soap so you will never run out. It's such a simple little service for the community. I'm aware that not every human will wash their hands after handling their genitals, but for those of us who aren't pigs, PLEASE LET THERE BE SOAP.

And while I'm at it, if you decide to install hand dryers, MAKE SURE THEY FUCKING WORK. Too many times have I pressed the button for a hand dryer and all that emits is the equivalent of a golden retriever breathing on my hands. This does not dry my hands. I could blow on my hands my damn self and have them dry quicker. WHY DO YOU EXIST? YOU SERVE NO PRACTICAL PURPOSE. Throw these things in the fucking garbage and give me some disposable hand towels. 

I know, I know, there has been improvements. Like those vortex hand-dryers that cause the skin on your hands to ripple.
