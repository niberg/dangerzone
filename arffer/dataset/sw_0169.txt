This is a long post. I have found myself completely numb, and while I can still force myself to do things which are "supposed" to help, nothing does. Please help me.

Hi. I suppose I want advice. Please give me advice. I'm just going to kind of stream-of-consciousness write out something now. It may end up long and life-story-esque, and I doubt it will be interesting to read, so I thank anyone who does read it.

Having written a novel, here's a **tl;dr**: I'm fairly certain my depression stems from loneliness, but after being single for five years, and having no real-life friends for two, I've found that even when opportunities arise to change this, I am no longer capable of caring enough to invest myself in them.

If you are doing me the kindness of reading it all, please refresh when you get to the end; I may add information as I think of it.

**Here's the backstory:**

I'm twenty-four years old, male, graduated at the top of my college class with a music degree, and now work as a programmer making a salary which, considering my demographic and degree choice, I can't complain about. From what I've read and learned about depression, it doesn't seem to discriminate between those who ostensibly have little to complain about, and those who clearly do. That being said, I'm quite certain I'm depressed, and have been for about three years now.

I had a girlfriend when I was nineteen, and she broke up with me at the end of freshman year of college. I "got over it" in a couple months, which seems more-or-less normal for first relationships. For the next several years, I regularly tried to have another relationship. Any time I tried to flirt or casually chat and gauge interest from the other party, I always got negative signals. If I made myself more obvious, it would become more obvious that feelings were not mutual. If I outright said my feelings and/or asked them out, I was always rejected. I've had a couple "oh shit, she was totally into me" realizations years later, but for two years, nothing. 

Fast forward to senior year. I rented an apartment with two of my closest friends, and despite my frustration in the love department, I was overall pretty happy. Genuinely happy. I was doing great in school, was learning new skills and interests, and had an active (if small) social circle. Then, September of senior year, it *finally* happened. A girl and I were mutually interested in each other, and I dated her...for about two weeks. I was let down when she ended it, but wasn't terribly invested yet. And hey, I had my first kiss in over two years--progress!

Then one of my apartment-friend-roommates, who I'll call K, broke up with his girlfriend of several years, and started dating the girl I saw for two weeks. I was irritated, and didn't like her being in the apartment (which I told him), but for the next month or so, I think I was fairly civil. I did start spending a lot more time in my room with the door closed and my curtains drawn, but overall I think I was okay.

**And then, the trigger:**

K's ex messaged me on Facebook. This was not unusual; she was part of my social circle, and while we weren't by any means close, I still talked to her now and then. She said she wanted to drink. I figured she wanted rebound sex or something, which I didn't think I was willing to give her, but I did visit her, and I brought liquor, and we drank. And I began to express my frustrations, both long-term and with the recent events. And somewhere along the line I said "fuck it" and decided to give her what she wanted, hoping it would make me feel better. Ordinarily I'd spare details of something like this, but there is one relevant detail, so consider this a TMI warning. As much as I tried, I couldn't get it up. I don't know if it's because I wasn't attracted to her, or because I was drunk, or because she was my friend's ex, or if it was general anxiety, but as much as I wanted, I could not become aroused. Still, she let me sleep with her, and it was nice being warm next to someone for a night.

Next morning I can't handle the guilt. I knock on K's door, and see that the girl I had been interested in is in his bed. I ignore that, and tell him I need to talk to him. I say "I slept with [his ex]." In retrospect, probably not the best way to begin that conversation.

I don't remember if he said anything, but he nope'd the fuck out of that situation immediately, and went back into his room. I knocked on the door and begged that we talk about it, and that I wanted to explain and apologize. About ten minutes after I gave up, I started to hear very loud sex from that room, which was adjacent to mine. Loud enough that it was obviously intentional. And they were laughing. They were having sex and laughing. It was clearly intended to fuck with me, and the combined malice and creepiness certainly did.

But I stayed quiet. I knew that if I let my emotions run the situation, I'd just dig myself deeper. Until winter break, I stayed in my room. I stopped cooking, stopped cleaning, stopped socializing in our common room with our friends. Then K went home for break, and I was able to relax for a month. After he got back, I saw him, and he behaved amicably, in a sort of "if we pretend this never happened, and if we're both chill, things can go back to normal" sort of way. But the only way I could do it was to numb my emotions. He never wanted to have the conversation about what happened, and I felt such a combination of loneliness, frustration, betrayal, and guilt that I couldn't function without closure. Lacking closure, I had to numb myself. I had to stop caring. And it worked. We stayed cordial, and things were fairly normal until graduation. But even if we were cordial, I had still lost a friend. I had never lost a friend before.

And that was the trigger. The shame, and guilt, and frustration of what I did and what he did, topped with my first experience of losing a friend in a fight. But once I learned to stop caring, it was like it didn't matter anyway.

**That's the main story. Here's how I've handled in the years since:**

I almost never think about those events anymore. When I do, I find that I don't really care about them anymore. I only think about them as the events which probably led to my current depression.

I moved to a small town for my programming job (kind of counter-intuitive, I know). I always lived in small towns, and my college was small, so this isn't a huge deal. I don't like cities, anyway. But it made the prospect of being un-lonely difficult. In an attempt to not give up, I've tried online dating. I've gone on dates with nine or ten girls in the 2.5 years since graduating, but it always fizzled out after one or two dates. Half the time, they were interested in getting intimate quickly. I found out in each of these times that I still can't become aroused around another person (when I'm alone, it's fine). When this happens, I don't feel shame, or guilt, or whatever men usually feel in this circumstance. I just feel annoyance, and find that in the moment I don't care. I've also found that with each girl I date, I care less and less. According to many people, this should be a good thing. It certainly helps me relax when I feel like there's nothing to lose. Unfortunately, I also feel like there's nothing to gain. And I can't stop feeling that way.

That's how my depression seems to manifest. I no longer care. I no longer care about dating, I no longer care about sex, and I very nearly no longer care about people. I have some close long-term friends online, but I haven't made any new friends since leaving college, and when I'm home, I am sitting at my computer, in a room with a blackout curtain.

*But here's the thing--*even then, I'm not entirely a shut in. I hike; I exercise. I read. After reading [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) months ago, I make it a point to never go to sleep having accomplished nothing during the day. And so I force myself to learn something, or to go for a jog, or to climb a mountain (I'm in an excellent area for mountain hiking). I guess I do this so that if I ever snap out of this, I can at least wake up to a good life I've built around myself. I'm sorry to say, unfortunately, that /u/ryan01's nice words, while motivating, haven't helped me, no matter how much I force myself to follow them.

But that's the thing. I force myself. I am no longer interested. Exercise supposedly produces endorphins, but after a long run, or a hike, or a couple hours at the gym, I feel nothing. As I said near the beginning, I have a music degree. I can no longer bring myself to play music, and haven't practiced since graduation because I feel NOTHING. I hardly even listen to music anymore because it doesn't cause me to feel emotions.

Here are a few things I've tried over the last several years in an attempt to feel things again:


* I tried to become an alcoholic, and then a pothead. Stupid ideas, yes, but I thought that if I could feel a compulsion in addiction, it would at least be **something**. I've since learned that I do not have an addictive personality. After drinking and vaping (I don't smoke) daily for months, I tried to quit, just to see if I could. And I could, and I did, because it turned out that I didn't care.

* I tried going for a drive along halfway across the country, to see sights and talk to people. Ended up doing neither of those things, and wasting $400 in gas because while I could force myself to drive, I wasn't able to feign interest in anything more because it turned out I didn't care.

* I constantly try to work toward the life I think I'd want if I wasn't depressed. I'm applying to a post-bac pre-med program, because I remember liking school, and I know I was interested in medicine. I do this hoping it may help, but in the mean time, I find that I still don't care.

* I *have* tried therapy. I've tried two different therapists (one after the first one didn't work and people urged me to try again with another), and I've told them my entire story. It didn't help, because it turned out that I didn't really care what they had to say, and after a couple dozen sessions, I felt like I was wasting money.

Sometimes I'm able to lift the numbness, ever so slightly, and sometimes this happens on its own. When it does, I find crushing sadness, difficult to extinguish. At the advice of many texts, I've tried to "feel out" the sadness, and see if I can "learn" anything from it, in order to resolve it. This doesn't work; I just become borderline suicidal, and frantically work to become numb again.

I don't think have self esteem issues. As I've indicated, I'm healthy. I'm also rather tall, which probably helps. I had varied interests, which I still attempt to pursue, even if it feels like I'm running through molasses while forcing myself to pursue them.

This has become even more of a novel than I originally predicted. I'm lonely. Horrifically so. Blindingly so. I have to distract myself from it, and force the emotions down, or I become overwhelmed with sadness and hopelessness. Whenever I make attempts to fix this, whenever I socialize or go on dates, I find that, paradoxically I don't care enough to make the new connection happen. If I force myself through this, there isn't another side to come out on--I just keep not caring and eventually stop attempting because it's not getting better.

**There is one thing I care about.** I care about fixing this. I want this fixed. I want this to stop, and would do almost anything to make it better. I miss being happy, and I miss forming new connections with people. I feel like the last five years of my life--what was supposed to be the *prime* of my life has been, at least socially, wasted. Previously by either my ineptness or bad luck with women, and now with my crushing apathy. I care about that, and when I realize I care about that I feel deep sadness, and I feel like I need to suppress it again.

I'm not suicidal yet, but when I feel sadness, I get flashes that make me feel like I may be headed for those thoughts, and I really don't want to end up there. I don't know what to do. 

If you've read this huge thing, thanks.
