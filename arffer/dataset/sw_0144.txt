Slept all day and deadline is tomorrow and all plans have failed and no new ideas

It's fucking cold and everything *fucking* hurts and I'm panicking because I'm out of ideas.  I'm going to just leave the phone here and walk away and not come back and do whatever I have to to die before tomorrow.

Goodbye and you're welcome.
