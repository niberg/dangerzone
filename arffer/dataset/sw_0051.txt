To late to learn

I never learned how to make friends my childhood was spent learning how to lie about every aspect of my life. How to hide from the world. Now I am twenty and I think that it is simply too late for me to learn how to do what comes naturally to most people. I feel like I am lost. I want friends but some things are simply not possible. I thought that it would get easier to live without friends but it doesn't it just keeps getting harder. If you don't have anyone what is the point of living.
