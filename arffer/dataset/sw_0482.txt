I lost someone I loved

I'm just at a point where I've been through so many failed relationships in the past, partly because I blame it on myself for caring too much and putting my heart out there, and now because I feel totally worthless.

Here's some backstory I guess, I met this girl named Maleishia about five months ago and we started talking, we got along really well she seemed to really understand what person I was and I guess things really hit it off for us. She's about two hours away from me and I seen her about every weekend after talking, we started to just develop a relationship we didn't even talk at first about wanting one but we both knew we could do it, we had the right chemistry and things felt just right, everything was right, the way we even fought after awhile felt different because we always resolved things.

Here's the problem, I wake up this morning, I found out she's moving five hours to Ottawa away from me, this is an extreme distance and she knows it, I know it. Long distance is do able, but it has gotten even harder and ever since she's been going through a lot, she's going to live with her mother who abandoned her at a young age, her father died in a tragic car accident when she was little, she lived with her grandparents after that.

I don't know how we will work in a relationship anymore and im so worried, she doesn't seem like she can handle it and I feel like im losing someone I truly love and care about.

What's the point of living anymore if I don't have someone to love and care about?
