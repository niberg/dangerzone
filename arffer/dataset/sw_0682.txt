So I give myself a week...

In one weeks time unless some seriously life changing events happen I am going to throw myself off of a bridge. I really wish I was kidding as I kind of started to like living.. I just can't go on like this and I can't live on the street. 

I live in a VERY dysfunctional family. I have no support outside my immediate family as most of them think I am either A: Drug Addict B: Criminal or C: Dead. All of which I am not. 

I can no longer live with these people and since I am not working at the moment, have debt because of them and seriously lost the will to deal with this any more I don't know what to do. If I can't find a new place to live, a job or something like that I will kill myself. This has been a long time coming.. 

It's selfish I know but my friends are the type of people that are there for you when you have something for them. They wont miss me. 

The family that know about me think I'm a burden. 

I've never had a meaningful relationship in my life due to years and years of emotional abuse so there's no ex out there waiting for me to call them. 

I have no savings or things of value so there's going to be no fighting over who gets what or a need for a will. 

all in all I have no one, nothing and I really don't care any more, I thought I'd be sad writing this, maybe breakdown halfway through... but I'm not. I feel almost at peace with my decision... almost as if someone switched the light at the end of the tunnel on for one last time.
