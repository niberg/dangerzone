What's the point?

I don't believe the lies about "it gets better" 

 1- You're not a psychic, stop making false claims.

 2- Psych/Therapist/Counseling is NOT an option, I'm broke, disabled and car-less. 

 3- Been waiting for it to get better for over fifteen years, it has gotten worse.



How much longer am I supposed to sit around just so other people can enjoy watching me suffer?? 

The only reason I haven't killed myself is I'm too much of a coward to do it and I don't want people to be hurt by my death, even though I think them guilting me into staying around is sadistic.



I have no will to live. I only eat because food is made for me and I am watched to make sure I eat.


I have no social life, no love live, no sex life, I hate my body, I hate everything about life and I have NO power to change things.

On top of all this I am about to turn 30, so my life is half over anyway.. It's not getting better, only worse. 


Life is a CHORE. I AM a burden on those I care about, and my life is a burden on me.

I constantly hear about my stupid siblings and their happy families, and celebrities getting married, all kinds of happiness EVERYWHERE AROUND but none for me. Why? What did I do to deserve my life?

I was abused and neglected as a child, I almost killed myself trying to appease the stupid Christian god as a teenager and since adulthood it has been one long spiral down hill as my mental health has declined at the same rate as my ability to cope with shit.

WHAT IS THE POINT OF LIVING WHEN LIFE IS MISERABLE WITH NO END IN SIGHT???
