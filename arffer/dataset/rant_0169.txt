Loving Christians

So I live in the bible belt. Yay! /s I get the local papers news updates on my phone and lately everyone is upset because they are experiencing a federally mandated rezoning over segregation and basically it boils down to the rush white patents don't want their kids going to school with the poor black kids although they are smart enough to come up with lame excuses such as: "my son has always dreamed of playing on [this] schools high school football team." Pretty sure that school has a football team too. Anyway a few days ago these rich white folks met downtown for a big showy group prayer! Yay! So this popped up in my news feed and I simply pointed out that their has was a scientific study put on by a Christian organization that proved prayer doesn't make a difference.  I expected angry replies, oh well. What I didn't expect was someone I know to see it and comment. A lady that went to my grandfather's church saw it and replied to it that my grandfather didn't feel that way. My grandfather who died last month. I'm sorry but I feel like throwing a dead man whom I loved despite difference in opinion to be a low blow. It doesn't argue what I said or offer an explanation it's just to make a stab at me because they can't or don't want to offer a logical argument and I should let it go and I will but I keep fantasizing sticking a fork in her eye. Ugh!
