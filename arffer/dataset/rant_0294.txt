I am sick of it.

I'm seriously getting sick and tired of being unable to walk half a year every god damn year. Maybe the pain is making me delusional, but this god damn health care system isn't helping me get a better knee.I have no god damn money. I just want to play basketball, and soccer, and all these sports again. There is no fucking reason I am on crutches for 2 months straight at 23 years old with one knee surgery already and an ailing knee that probably is gonna be fucked up for the rest of my life because I don't have the money to pay for a fucking surgery. Fuck this shit. Fuck the economy. Fuck the fact that people like me, hard working college students, can't have a decent living because some fuckers in congress decide to choose their power over their fucking country. That our government chooses to elect its own leaders under the facade and guise of being bipartisan. Grow some fucking balls, America. I am sick and fucking tired of all of it. And I can't be the only one with these issues. I can't even fucking work. This is absolute bullshit. 

All I want is SOMEONE to fucking come and help me and my wife out. We work our ASSES off. She breaks her heart EVERY DAY going into a job she DESPISES. I CAN'T EVEN WORK BECAUSE I GO TO SCHOOL FULL TIME AND I HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL FOREVER BECAUSE I CHOSE THE WRONG FUCKING MAJOR. NOW I AM PAYING FOR IT BY TAKING CLASSES ON A GOD DAMN STUPID FUCKING SCHEDULE WHERE MY COLLEGE CHOOSES TO DO A FUCKING TRIMESTER FUCKING SCHEDULE WHERE SOME CLASSES ARE OFFERED AT CERTAIN TIMES EVERY FUCKING 3 YEARS.

I am tired of being lied too by my government. "For the people" are the first three words in the constitution, and yet EVERY FUCKING DAY we have people who don't believe in that. Who rather believe in a fucking deity. Who rather fuck over the citizens, people I see kill themselves everyday, to just fulfill their LUST for power. 

I am sick and tired of my GOD DAMN FUCKING IRRESPONSIBLE PARENTS. I am sick and tired of having to blow them off because they can't fucking accept I married a wonderful person who is the only person on my support team. I am in god damn tears right now because I am in so much god damn pain, and the moment I ask for help, for some money so I can go to the doctors, they tell me I can pay it off monthly. I DON'T HAVE THE GOD DAMN MONEY TO PAY IT OFF SEEING AS IM FUCKING PAYING OFF BILLS AND EVERY GOD DAMN THING ELSE LEAVING ME WITH 200 BUCKS A MONTH FOR FOOD FOR 2 PEOPLE.

I am SICK of fucking douchebags like the person across the street who CALLED THE TOWING COMPANY ON US when we LIVE IN THE GOD DAMN COMPLEX because she couldn't get the spot in front of the apartment. I SHOWED UP at 6 IN THE GOD DAMN MORNING AND SHE SHOWED NO GOD DAMN REMORSE OR EVEN A FUCKING SHED OF TEAR AS SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO PAY the 250 FUCKING DOLLARS IT TOOK FOR US TO GET THE CAR OUT. O WAIT IT DOESN'T MATTER, LET'S JUST DRIVE OFF IN OUR GOD DAMN 2015 BMW.

I am sick and tired of being unable to have a family or a support team. I am continuing from before. I am sick and tired of being judged by my cousins and aunts and uncles for saying fuck you to my parents who have let me suffer and go through god damn couch surfing and fucking homelessness, while working 40+ hours a week and going to school fucking full time. I couldn't even make enough money for an apartment yet BECAUSE I WORKED FOR FUCKING TIPS WHERE SOMETIMES I WOULDNT EVEN MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. And then they have the FUCKING AUDACITY to claim they KNOW WHATS BEST FOR ME? OH I DONT KNOW, WHY NOT SOME FUCKING SUPPORT WHEN I BRING HOME THE GIRL I LOVE? OR HOW ABOUT SHOWING SOME SUPPORT WHEN I FUCKING SWITCHED MAJORS FROM BEING A DOCTOR BECAUSE ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO DO, BUT WHAT MY ASSHOLE PARENTS WANTED ME TO DO. How could I EVER believe you "loved" me when you THREW ME ON THE STREET 3 TIMES. WHY? Because I was on the computer too much. OH WAIT A SECOND, NOT ONLY DID I GO TO SCHOOL FULL TIME, I WORKED FULL TIME. AND WHEN I CAME HOME AFTER WORKING 15 FUCKING HOURS I GET KICKED OUT BECAUSE RATHER THEN SPEND TIME WITH YOU, I'D RATHER SPEND TIME WITH NO ONE AND BE ON MY COMPUTER. OH WAIT SOME ASSHOLE IS GONNA SEE THIS AND BE LIKE "THEY WANTED TO SEE YOU". NO. I have NEVER seen them NOT have an ulterior motive with me. THey wanted to present to their parents, their friends (who are all fucking extremely loaded BTW. OH WAIT THAT SEEMS CONSISTENT WITH BEING A GOD DAMN NARCISSIST). Their fucking POSITION IN LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN LOVE. SO WHEN THEY THROW ME AWAY ALL I GET IS A FUCKING THERAPIST AND A SLEW OF RUMORS ON HOW I AM UNSTABLE.

Are you fucking joking? I've been stable for 5 years ever since I have started college. But being homeless, getting denied any support with my wife and I, getting my wife's father (this is a good man who has helped out and is a wonderful person, regardless if he is a pastor and doesn't believe in evolution... he is still a good person, and doesn't force his opinions and trusts my wife and I).

Oh and lets talk about the job my parents gave me. They made me fucking work for a god damn front for the fucking russian mob who fucking SUED ME AFTER I QUIT BECAUSE I WAS SICK OF BEING TREATED LIKE SHIT AT WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. (The russian mob thing is a little off, they def could be.) My dad EVEN FUCKING PROTECTED HIS FRIEND AND SAID THAT WE SHOULD TAKE IT TO COURT. OH REALLY DAD, ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF LAWYERS? NO? THEN THE ONLY THING I CAN FUCKING DO IS PAY 1200 DOLLARS OF MONEY I DON'T HAVE TO THESE FUCKING SHITHEADS WHO LITERALLY STARTED THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF MY SEMESTER.


Literally, the past few months have been hell for me. I really needed to rant. So bad. I am crying because I can't walk, and I can't think because I am in pain, and I only have my beautiful, amazing wife and her family (Who live 12000 miles away by the way). (She lives with me, my wife does).

Her and I are i this together, and she breaks down every 3 weeks. It is so hard for her. SO HARD for her. And its getting incredibly hard for me to keep a straight face and be her rock when I am breaking down so fucking hard because she has NO ONE here, and thought she was coming to something.

This is fucking disturbing, and the shitty ass health care system isn't helping.
Also I love my dog archie :3
