The "new" common core math is actually good. It's the idiot parents with bad attitudes that are holding us back.

I see a Facebook post about how subtraction is taught.  The old way with borrowing.  The new way, the "Common Core" way, which is the actual way most people do subtraction IN THEIR HEAD.  

99% of the comments are idiot adults who crucify the new way "if it ain't broke" and "it must go" and "I am a researcher with 3 years Calculus under my belt and this new way confuses me".

FUCKING REALLY!!??!!  Come on!!  So many people boast "USA USA USA" being the best country in the world (I know we are not, just saying), yet grown ass adults get overwhelmed and confused by a different method of teaching kids how to subtract. 

To be honest, the new way is easier because you don't have any of that borrowing which can get you easily if you don't know what you're doing.

I'm just disappointed in people.  I thought we were smarter than that.
