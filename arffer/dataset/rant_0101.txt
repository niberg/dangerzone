I'm pretty darn upset

SO I wanted to make a gif for /r/photoshopbattles (dickbutt, of course) but today my Adobe Flash payment ran out and I hate Creative Cloud. So I had to make my beautiful gif in Gimp. After working for ~20 minutes I'm finally done... and it crashes. I have a brand new computer, but it's slow as heck after I had to let a person living at my house "use" it (my grandmother is more computer literate, and she uses hers once every couple of months). So I'm expecting her to use the computer to get back up on her feet, but nope, she uses it to download random stuff and cry on facebook about her latest brakeup. Now my computer is kind of broken, and that brings us up to speed, where I have just lost 20 minutes worth of glorious dickbutt. I give up.
    
    &lt;/rant&gt;

Thanks for reading, kind internet user.
