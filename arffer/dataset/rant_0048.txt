Yesterday I had to cut ties with my longest living friend

has been a shitty one.... i can't explain it... but he still continues to hide stuff from me.... and will insult me to the max when i make him angry. yesterday it started with sports. I made a dumb comment about Kobe (obviously I don't know anything about sports) but he was fighting his case why I should speak or say anything if I don't know the game. And that because he knows it it's his territory and I have to oblige by it........wtf....... i'm not your bitch. and everything I question when I smoke weed becomes a burden to him. Like I shouldn't ask any questions. And I shouldn't dig deep into stuff and learn to let things go. Fuck that I want curiosity to kill me. haha not really but fuck him. I'm sorry I made you question yourself in front of your brother. and maybe I embarrassed you.... but don't be mad bro UPS is hiring. Are there any real people left to have real conversations with? That don't have to become arguments or a debate. Like come on... express freely. I don't wanna talk about kim kardashians ass. or the secrets of our mutual friends. blabber mouth. Besides that, he proceeded to tell me about a "friend" i've been trying to contact. I've been cut off from the friendship without notice. because i'm not successful nor a hustler. bitch you isn't doing anything with your life but fucking other man while your baby daddy brings the bread. then shoves his hundreds in my face Ok... but  i've been telling my best friend and i've told him i have this problem  and now he keeps it from me.  i feel stupid. don't try to make me feel any worse. but i will always be that friend who "wants trouble" just by a discussion. because i get emotional.and nobody likes to see that. because we're made of plastic and we have to talk about who's fucking who.  anyway thanks for reading. it's so hard to let your high school friends go....much love
