People older than 15 arguing about politics breeds contempt for humanity

It baffles me to see people eligible for a drivers license argue, in serious manner, about politics. These midterms were the most expensive (marketing-wise) elections in history. It's a proven fact that elections were always won by the party that invested the most $ in the campaign.

People who still engage in debates about these things are either deliberately trolling (for some reason) or they're just plain stupid, functioning retards. Nobody with a half of functioning brain would buy into "A vs B" debate.

Who cares and how come people still fall for it? They elect A, and then they get sick of them, then they elect B and get sick of them, then it's back to A...and people seriously talk and defend their positions about this and are willing to break friendships over it, spend hours online typing comments trying to prove their point...

It's no wonder that we have those eugenics rumors going on, if I were in position of power I would definitely look to control the herd of the functioning retards bumbling on this planet.
