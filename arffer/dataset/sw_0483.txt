Is this all in my head?

If you take a look at my other posts, you'll see that I am obsessed about being the smartest there is. That's my purpose in life. Other than that, I have no purpose. When my so called demons are at bay, i spend all day sleeping. Waking only to eat or take a piss. I am seeing a counselor that is supposedly the best in this area, but it's not working out. To top it all off, I have a standardized test to do in the morning and a math test on Sunday which I am probably flunking. And the worst thing, is that the main reason I am doing is probably to get attention.
