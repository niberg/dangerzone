Gamergate Morons

Hey, you guys made me take something I used to give zero shits about (feminism in gaming) and actually start respecting the opinions of the opposing side.

The way you brigade ANY and ALL posts across the internet having to do with your "movement" with your emasculated cries of "THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY WAAAA" and "WE HAVE BEEN SLANDERED BY THE MEDIA *SNIFFLE*" make me think very poorly of you. 

It's a lot like listening to the annoying kid in class whining endlessly about how nobody likes or respects him. GEE, I WONDER WHY.

You had a chance to make some sort of point. Not sure what it was, because you opened your collective mouths. Whoops.
