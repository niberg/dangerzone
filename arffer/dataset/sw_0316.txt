I don't wanna do this. I feel it's the only way to get better.

I am 18. I know it;s young. I know I have my whole life ahead of me. But I'm always alone since graduation. I lost touch with all my friends. My ex left me after I was kicked out of the army for being majorly depressed and I was homeless. my mom constantly beats me down with insults and telling me I'm a piece of trash. I work a job I hate where I'm over work and physically exhausted. I have no one to talk to and it feels like I'm becoming hollow and it hurts. I've given up on all my dreams and ambitions and I just want to kill myself.
