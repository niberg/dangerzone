People are chronically non-committal

People don't like planning things too early or too late or at all. Weekdays are bad but so are weekends. On top of that, it has to be something they are very interested in because people have been chronically non-committal and apathetic to boot. It's frustrating to see plans fall through to the point where getting something off the ground doesn't seem worth the trouble. I wish someone else would take the initiative but it rarely happens.
