Self medication isn't working anymore.

Hello all! I suffer from BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and these last few days have really been hard on me. See, I abuse THC to the max. Not just a stoner, I NEED IT. When I'm not high..my thoughts seem to attack me. I talk myself down, emotions get started and my disorder makes emotional stability already difficult as it is.

I recently faced eviction but was only given 2 days notice when a final notice was given to me. My roomates, 4 of them over the course of 4 months didn't pay their rent. I paid my lardlord everything I had and still lost the house. I was at court when the police and landlord processed the eviction. I lost my cat that day. They threw all my food in the dumpster first. I wasn't able to save my lifestock (I had chickens) whom I dearly loved. One of the roomies who screwed me over was my own younger brother. 

My family abandoned me for the most part. I was placed in foster care, than placed with my schizophrenic grandmother..that was fun. After a string of really bad relationships, I'm left hollow. I'm not attracted to anyone anymore, depression, even when high is real. I feel unattractive, I've dropped some serious wieght. 6'3 145 and still dropping =\

I can't pull myself out of this rut. I tried hanging myself. My ceiling beam nearly broke and the support I placed in snapped. It's not the first time I've failed either. What am I going to do? I'm afraid because I know one of these times I'm going to succeed but at the same time, what's left?
