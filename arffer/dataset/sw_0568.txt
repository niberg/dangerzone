Suffer from depression and life is really kicking me down right now.

I am losing my mind right now.  I am broke my business that barely made enough to pay me less than minimum wage is finally going under.  My car is broke and I can't afford to fix it.  No matter what I try or what I do over the past four years I can't get ahead at all.  I just further behind and worse off.  People say to keep trying and it will get better.  When?  It has been getting worse and worse for years now.  Why keep going?  Even when it was "great" my life was barely better than homeless.  I just feel like at this point in my life it isn't worth trying to live anymore.  I fight all the time to not kill myself.  Now though after being homeless and broke for the last three years, I just don't see why I should keep fighting.  While this is a cry for help, it also helps to vent and do this versus giving up.  What sucks the most is I never have anyone I can talk to as I don't want my friends or family to start watching me or treating me with kid gloves because I might kill myself over a wrong sentence or something.  Life sucks enough I don't need people treating me weird because I told them I think about suicide every night.
