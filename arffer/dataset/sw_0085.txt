Questions about voluntary admittance to hospital

Hi all. A little over a year ago I was involuntarily admitted (302'd?) to a psychiatric hospital after attempting to kill myself. I've been feeling very down lately (to the point of crying), and, though I don't plan to off myself, I'm wondering if voluntarily signing myself into a hospital would be a good idea. Thing is, last time it was a terribe experience where I was forced to stay there for over two weeks. I wasn't given any attention aside from being told when the food arrived. In short, the experience was painful and left me feeling subhuman. Will a short voluntary stay be any different? Does anyone have an experience they'd like to share? Also, I'm a university student. Will this negatively affect my school records? Will my school be notified as to why I will be absent?
