I'm Living a Lie

I can't stop shaking right now.   

&amp;nbsp;  
I've been lying to my parents for 5 years. They think I just graduated from university when in fact I failed my second term, never even finished my first year. My parents are so proud of me. It's all a lie. I honestly don't know what to do right now. I have no friends, I have nobody except for my parents, where do I even begin to pick up my life? They're coming to visit me later tonight or tomorrow, and there's no way of continuing to lie to them anymore. I'm a horrible fucking son. At this point I don't think there would be much of a difference if I told them the truth or died, either way the son they thought existed will vanish. At least if I'm gone I won't be a burden, and my life insurance policy would be more helpful to them than I ever was.

I attempted suicide 10 days ago, tried to overdose on insulin. I remember waking up a couple hours later with what felt like the worst hangover ever, but that's all. So I looked into other methods, and based on my research, Hanging was the way to go. And I honestly just attempted to hang myself before typing this. I don't know if my rope is too thick, but there's no way I could block my carotid arteries without crushing my trachea. It is absolute agony, I ended up suspending my entire body off my bedroom door, just barely. The rope I bought tends to stretch a little, and it stretched just enough for my feet to touch the ground and it took me about 2 minutes trying to undo the rope from the door knob whilst trying to breath. I was so close to passing out but I couldn't stand it. Forgive the terrible editing and unorganized post, but I'm writing this in a hurry. This is entirely my fault, I lied and I just kept digging myself into a hole with more lies. I honestly don't know what to do right now, I need help.
