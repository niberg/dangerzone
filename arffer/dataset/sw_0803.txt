I don't want to keep going

I'm trying so hard for my parents. I don't want to hurt them and they're doing everything to try and help me but I just don't want to face a lifetime of depression and relapses and troubles and despair. I feel so desperate and scared and I can't feel a will to live anymore. Why do I even feel like this? I have amazing supportive friends and family, they understand and accept me. I'm not poor, I'm not unsuccessful, I have so much, why do I find it so difficult to carry on? :( I'm sorry I'm ranting. I don't know where else to post this.
