Giving this a shot

I woke up this morning and realized that this might be my last day alive. Things have come to a head and I can't go back. My wife hates me, and the only way to get out of my shitty factory job is to join the military. I went and signed a contract, was put in the DEP, and now I don't want it anymore. My family says I should get out of my contract if I can, but my wife is pushing me to go to boot camp and see how it plays out. My anxiety has gotten out of hand, and I can't stand talking to my friends because they don't give a fuck about me. I'm tired of this life, I want out, and I'm convinced that this is the only way.
