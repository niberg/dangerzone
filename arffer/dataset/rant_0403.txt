Hey, forehead!

You started dating my roommate. Now he's not my friend anymore because you're convinced him I'm a bad dude. You said I was contaminating him because we spent time together, now he practically lives with you.

You're the fucking pollution.

It's your fault I've lost one of my best friends. It's your fault he doesn't know how much depression's killing me lately, because it's your fault he's never fucking here, you and your stupid continental-sized forehead. 

And don't even try to say you can get away with it because of religion.You're everything that's wrong with Christianity, hostile to everything you don't get and too damn ignorant to try and learn. 

And enjoy your stay in Hell for groping the shit out of my roommate in church, you harpy. You brainwashed him and he doesn't even fucking listen when I try to tell him that I need to talk because I thought about killing myself in the shower.

And don't think I didn't see the hate stare, either, and the one you gave my girlfriend. You should look at the ground - you're not worthy to even be near her. 

Thanks for ruining a great friendship.

Bitch.
