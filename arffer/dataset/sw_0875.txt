this is what I'm thinking

this is what I'm thinking alone at home and a little bit too drunk and ill delete tho sin the morning. 

11/1/2014

this is why I stay home instead of going out. 
Because they will always end up happy making out by the door and ill be stuck wondering where to go because they people I came with are making out by the fucking door. 
I should have just cleaned and done laundry. 
I wish I could slit my throat or my arms 
Not my wrists because that’s just a cry for attention but I don’t want attention I just want to be done 
If it wasn’t for fucking mom and dad expecting me to be the good one 
I would be dead
And that fucking guy 
There is a reason people are on an app instead of out in the world looking for actual people 
Its because they are short and can’t take a fucking hint. 
Blood alcohol: way too fucking much 
I like that nick guy he was nice, he helped me escape from that stupid app guy. 
He is tall and cute
But he is rachels forever nd always 
And I have a fat chin and ugly teeth and just all in all very unattractive 
Im never doing that rock wall again
I just want someone to like me that isn’t a fucking creep or weirdo or loser 
Just a nice guy that is tall and nice 
Id like to jump into a dark unforgiving black hole of nothing and be gone forever
I wish I was never born, I really fucking wish I was never born, I wish I was done. 
Hell doesn’t exist it doesn’t matter
And that guy is interestered in beautiful Rachel in her room probably making out or better yet just talking 
And this is what im fucking doing. Do I wallow or do I ignore it 
Im so good at ignoring it
