She's a Narcissist, she's not my problem

Hello everyone!

:] I'm here today to talk about why when I use certain words to describe someone, I.. 

Oh, I dunno,

MEAN WHAT I FUCKING SAY?

I have 3 "sisters" and I only recognize two of them as siblings. The third one is probably fucked in the head, and nobody seems to want to acknowledge it.

I've talked about her here before, the whiny little brat who never grew up and constantly needs others to hold her hand. Nothing is her fault and everyone else is to blame. 

So when it comes up in a conversation, and I say I have 2 sisters, people can normally do the basic math to figure out that either my mother or I am lying, as my mother has 4 children.

I'm not lying, I just hate her and no longer wish to have association with her.


So when people press the issue, why are they so surprised I use, "Strong words?" I'm not in Kindergarten, I'm allowed to use the word hate.

"You don't hate her! You just strongly disagree with how she acts, not who she is!"

No. That's not how it fucking works. We have a word already, and that word is hate. Who she is and how she acts are two very intertwined things, and I can't fucking stomach either of those two things, let alone put them together into one fleshbag.

When I'm 18 and independent, she's never allowed into my life. No money, no birthdays, no phonecalls, no visits. I'm not going to spend any more of my fucking time, energy, and emotional well-being into servicing a glorified toddler. She can crash and burn on her own, I'm not going to get caught up in the fireball.

We have words, don't tell me I can't use them to describe how I feel.
