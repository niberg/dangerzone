Really need some help

15/f here. I've been depressed for two years now, and I've gotten that far. But, now, trying not to die is as difficult as trying not to fall asleep. I don't have friends, but I do have family, and I don't want to make them sad. I'm very religious, too, and I'm worried that I won't go to heaven if I die now. Please help.
