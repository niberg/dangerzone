So happy I want to end it now.

So right now after 2 years of being depressed im the happiest ive ever been. Ive never talked to anyone about my depression before but i was visiting some friends to party over the past few weeks and met a girl who is amazing. We talked and i trust her with told her everything she is really caring and just a super nice human. Thing is now i have experienced what i believe to be the happiest i have ever been I want to end it all as my one promise i made 2 years ago when i first thought about committing suicide was i was going to go happy. I have no talents and useless at everything and because i didnt goto school often because this I got awful grades. I dont want to go on into the future knowing that life wont get better than it is now. I cant find anything on the internet related. My only passion is travelling. Not something i can really do as a career though is it. Does anyone agree or get me here?
