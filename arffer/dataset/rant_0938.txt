You are all right, but you are all wrong.

Stumbling over a pretty touchy conversation, I had a sudden realization. You are all right, but you are all wrong. Yup. Paradox much? This isn't  an angry rant. This is more of a calm, more-people-should-hear-about-this rant. Okay, back to what I was saying.

The conversation I ran into was about abortion. Person A had researched about abortion and declared their opinion about it publicly. They decided that abortion is wrong, and anyone who aborts a baby is a bad person for doing so. Person B publicly expressed their opinion on the subject. They said that you don't know the situation that a person could be in so you should keep your opinions to yourself (hypocrisy is inevitable). Now who is right? I mean killing an unborn human (even before it is a human being) sounds pretty bad. But, if someone was raped and got pregnant, that person should have the right to keep it or not (this was just an example, there are plenty of other situations, I know). These are opinions, not facts. That is something everyone seems to forget. You cannot prove one to be right ultimately. 

Everyone is different. Therefore, everyone has different opinions. We have different, likes, interests, favorites, preferences. None of which are right, and none of which are wrong. Everyone is wired differently. I could like apples and you may not like apples. "They are sweet and juicy, how could you not enjoy them?" I'd say. "They are sweet and juicy, how COULD you enjoy them?" You'd say. I like the sweetness of them and the juice, but to you, they aren't qualities you enjoy. Why can't I just convince you that they taste good? How can't you enjoy an apple like I can? It's because no two humans are the same.

The more we try to push someone into agreeing with our personal opinions, the more our qualms will grow. This world is so imperfect. The faster we can realize that, the faster we can learn to deal with one an other. Now, I'm not saying this world we live in sucks, and is heading down the dumps. I'm saying, we can't expect everything to bend to our will. Not everything will happen our way. We shouldn't spend our time raging war against each other because we can't see eye to eye about religion. We can't break off friendships because we don't agree on if same sex marriage is okay or not. We are more evolved than that. We should understand that our morals differ from one an another. 

It's extremely tough to swallow our pride, especially if you are a very proud person (like myself). I can not quit an argument unless they see my point, or unless they understand my point. I'm stubborn like that. But, I have to learn I'm not necessarily right. In my head, every part of my argument makes sense. I bet that in their head, every part of their argument makes sense too. No one is wrong, but no one is right. 

I really wish that people could understand this. So that the next time someone gets in an argument the phrase, "your opinion doesn't matter" is absolutely irrelevant. In all truth, opinions are ineluctable. You'll never be able to get around people's opinions. Their opinion does matter, because someone out there agrees and it's okay to express opinions. Being angry about someone stating a personal value, or principle isnt an appropriate thing to do. Agree or disagree, you can rarely change someone's opinions without some sort of skirmish.

Let's all just accept each other for what they are. If thats too much, then keep yourself away from those people. I'm just sick of seeing pointless arguments that seem to never end... Aren't you?
