'What do you want to be when you're older?'

Ok context first, I'm 16 from the UK and currently struggling to find what to do with my life.

I left school not too long ago and achieved *mediocre* results (5c's 2d's) and decided to go to college to study electrical installation and have the trade of being an electrician "under my belt". 6-7 weeks in and I **hate** it, the tutor, the people, the math, the science, everything. 

I tried to change courses tp something I felt would be more suited to me, iMedia, which is to do with advertising and other aspects of media only to be shotdown by the most unhelpful helper in the world. Her answer is a straight no as she says I left it too late. How the fuck am I supposed to know what I want a career in, I have 0 previous work experience and no  knowledge otherwise to make a judgement call on what I want to be, so I choose something I thought would benefit me, however after trying to stick with it I realise that was a bad move, but no one else seems to understand what I'm trying to say, they all go "then why did you pick electrical installation?" She gave me 4 options, "suck it up" as she put it and deal with it for the rest of the year, leave college and go to sixthform, a course which is aimed at people who don't know what they want to do (this may seem like a good idea but isn't) and then the one I'm considering, a traineeship which is unpayed job knowledge. My head hurts and im writing this on my phone, so I apologise for any mistakes, I just don't know what to fucking do and I don't want to waste a year of my life and education doing something I don't want to do. Help. Talk to me, tell me a way to get around it, just please do something.
