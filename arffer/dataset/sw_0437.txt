I'm lost.

I'm a freshman in College, I thought college would be at least somewhat easy. It's not. I moved away to Arizona for college this summer, leaving my home in California; all my friends and boyfriend. It's been four months into the semester (maybe more) I am failing all my classes. Don't have the courage to tell my parents, every time I call them I want to cry. I just don't know what to do. I haven't made friends here, don't do anything but stay in my dorm unless I have class. I need help. I don't know what to do, I only feel like there is two options. My depression is really bad right now, and I need someone to talk to. I don't want my parents to be pissed at me. I just am so lost and depressed. Each day feels like a struggle.
