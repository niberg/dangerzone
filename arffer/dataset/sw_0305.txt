And miles to go before I sleep

Kindness creeps out from the dark,  
soothing chaos into rest,  
and gives forever, until it doesn't;  
replaced by apathy, at best.  
  
But apathy is peace at last  
when bitterness is called to trial  
to stand accused for what it wasn't,  
and let go in such defeated style  
  
that honesty drops to its knees  
and prays to god for execution  
knowing well that doctors mustn't  
enable such uncouth delusion.  
  
So Kindness creeps out from the dark,  
and soothes itself to dreamless sleep;  
perhaps forever, or until it doesn't  
hurt so god damn much to weep
