27 is a good age to end it on.

Supposedly 27 is a popular age for people to end their own lives. I think I'll be joining those who thought so too. Later this month I will turn 27 and it'll just be a matter of planning it out. I've been thinking about it for a long time and I think it'll go just fine.

There is little use for a pathetic and disgusting person like me. Who has very little interesting about him, very little drive and motivation. Who's best success in his life was to work as a pizza delivery for a year when he was 18 and has never had a real relationship (or even had sex for that matter).

What would any employer want with a boring, unconfident person who can never be punctual anyway? It's no wonder I'm such an utter fucking failure. Maybe once I could have been considered to have useful skills, but after all this time, I am just miles behind my peers.

I sit at the computer and eat shit food. Leeching off my parents' money. That is what there is to my life. Horrible.
