Breakup taking the last thing in my life that means anything

Hey guys. 

I've had a rough few months and I'm feeling pretty hopeless right now. Unfortunately I got way too wrapped up in my two year relationship that is about to end. I was already having issues before this. I haven't been going to class, getting out of bed, or really doing anything. 

Right now I live with my boyfriend. I have a dorm room waiting for me to pick up the key. So at least I have that option. But I haven't been to class in over a month so I don't think I can salvage the semester...

I just don't know what to do with myself. I don't have goals or direction in my life. I hardly have any friends. Once this relationship is over I feel like there's nothing left for me. I just want a way out.
