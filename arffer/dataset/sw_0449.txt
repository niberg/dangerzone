I'm going to do it soon

Overall basically everything fucking sucks and has been for three years, I have no other way to put it. My depression has made me useless. I don't do anything anymore, this resulted in me not being able to do anything for my self anymore. This caused me to be behind in my school work, cause me to hate my self more. Everytime I wake up and my first reflex is to hate my self because I woke up meaning I still haven't killed myself. Anyways... This post is a waste of time and I guess the only reason im doing this is to atleast have a conversation before I go.
