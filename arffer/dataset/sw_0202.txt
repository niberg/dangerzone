Am I being a coward?

I am hurting my family with a shitty attitude towards them.

I am dissapointing them by being fucking lazy

Today they told me they couldn't support me any more. I've tried everything to get out of this depression but I just cant. I feel like a lazy fuck all day

They only thing I'm good at is the piano and they just said that i can't play it until i finish school.

I dont know what the fuck is wrong with me, do i have mental problems? 

I can't do this anymore I feel like a useless piece of shit right now. I can't focus on stuff, I have bad hygiene, no friends.

Am I being a coward for wanting to leave all this behind? I really cant take this pressure anymore
