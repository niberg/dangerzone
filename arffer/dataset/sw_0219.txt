I just can't live with myself

I should probably use a throwaway for this but fuck it. I don't even care.

I fucking hate myself. I hate everything about myself. I can't socialize properly, I constantly fuck up with guys, everything I do is disgusting. Every interaction I have with anyone is cringey and disgusting. I am such a revolting piece of shit and I just fucking hate that I'm like this, but it's just who I am and I can never change and be normal. I was raised by a psychotic narcissist and it turned me into the fucked up piece of garbage I am today. I am an 18yr old freshman in college with no friends, no ambition, I'm failing all of my classes, never been legitimately kissed (the only time a guy would ever come close to my hideous body was while extremely intoxicated) and I know my life is going nowhere. Even my family is fucked up forever, and we used to be so close. But I just feel so disconnected from them now, and things will never be happy like they used to be. All of the happiness I had in my life is gone.

In highschool I at least had some semblance of happiness. I got good grades, I was athletic. I didn't have a lot of friends but it was okay because I had a great time with my close best friends. But I feel so far apart from them now, and since coming to college I have lost all of my ambition in sports and academics, and have become this revolting slob that can't do anything productive. The amount of weight I have gained in just 2 months if fucking remarkable.

I think it's time to kill myself. I don't see any possibility of any real joy coming in to my life, because I am just too much of a fuck to ever make any friends or have any relationships. God turns away from my prayers, I am completely and utterly alone. 

Right now I'm just procrastinating. But soon I will have the courage to fucking end this shitshow of a life already. I'm planning on jumping off a bridge near me. It's a hell of a view from that bridge.
