[Rant] Everyone is delaying my suicide by being an asshole.

I'm not usually an angry person. I'm ready to kill myself, but it's not an impulsive decision. I've considered it for a long time, and I'm ready to go.

Except that everyone has turned into a fucking dickbag these past few weeks. My fucking friend is pissy because I forgot to give him back his hat and left it in my car. My sister just went on a two hour rant about something I did when I was twelve years old. Even a lot of my acquaintances have been really annoyed with me lately. I just want them to shut the fuck up and let me leave things on a positive note. I know that people will feel bad if they remember their last conversation with me as an argument.

But I'm running out of patience. If these people won't let me make amends, they deserve to have this on their conscience.
