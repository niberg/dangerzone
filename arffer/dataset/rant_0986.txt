I hate assignments that have a fucking final boss problem

I'm tired and I just finished up a huge problem set and I'm ready to go to sleep. BUT WAIT LETS THROW THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN THERE BECAUSE FUCK YOUR SLEEP AND STUDY TIME. I can't stand this, it's too frustrating especially when you think it's all over.
