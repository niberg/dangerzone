My old boss is ridiculous.

Seriously, fuck that guy. Not only was he trying to get me to do old work related favors for someone that forced me to quit my old job, but now he has the nerve to tell me that since we have an agreement and he put in a good word for me with my new employer, I pretty much owe him? Fuck that noise! 

I get it, I made an agreement with you when I initially quit so that I could make a little money and help me through the transition period, but what you're asking me for was not part of our agreement. Not to mention that you trying to say that you "sort of helped me" get my job because you gave me a good reference is fucking unbelievable. 

I agreed to do 2 things! I completed the first, and the second one was cut short by a month because the system changed, but as far as I'm concerned, I upheld my end of the bargain. So fuck you. You consistently let that guy treat me like shit and do all sorts of illegal bullshit. If you try and fuck up my job, I will come after you, you pompous fuck. Thanks for the three years spent at a job that I busted my ass at and used to love going to work for, until you hired that shithead and pretty much made me despise my job. Great job buddy.
