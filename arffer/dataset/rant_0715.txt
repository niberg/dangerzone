Rant about Microsoft

Woke up today and my computer said my windows wasn't genuine anymore. Figure someone got a hold of it via some kinda malware. Went about the steps to fix it. Call Microsoft with the CD key. They tell us Microsoft has banned the CD key. We explain to them that we bought it via the Microsoft store about two years ago with a student discount. They straight up tell us we are lying. 

Well gee fuck me sideways, I had no idea we *didn't* spend $70 on that there windows 7! Guess we'll blow some more money on windows 8 or 10! Thanks Microfuckyourself!
