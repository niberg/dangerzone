I need advice

Ok, here goes....
I am 20 years old. I have been diagnosed with type two bipolar disorder a few weeks ago. I'm on medication, but nothing seems to be working. I'm stuck in a hole where nothing is going to get better, so honestly, what is the point of continuing on every day just to Suffer? I have suicidal thoughts daily, and they just seem to be getting louder and louder...
