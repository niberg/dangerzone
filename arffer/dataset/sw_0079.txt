I met a girl , Feel something

I have been trying to make a post on here for a while. I could never think of what to say... I've posted to help people with parts of my story. Its a long and sob story I assure you. Key points:

-Mom died when I was 4 of cancer

-Brother had cancer 

-watched my friend flip a car full of friends, pulled 4 out, and found one crushed under the car three feet from my face

-been cheated on in 3 out of 4 serious relationships

-one told me after 5 months of cheating

-walked in on one getting double teamed at her friends birthday

-one was fucking my cousin a block away

-other girl had medical issues and let me go so it wouldn't hurt me as much had something happened, she left us a few weeks later

-seeing my friend under the car left me not normal for a while , 2 out of my 4 teachers decided not to pass me when I skipped the last three weeks because I was fucked up. 
No graduation. great.

-I had a home invasion where three guys with bats came into my house, packed up all my shit, and took it away while holding me on the couch with bats(as I'm stoned as fuck after a hard day at work). 

etc
etc
etc... so on and so forth. 

But 

A few days ago I started talking to this girl . She is great, we agree about everything, she is funny, she is beautiful, she gives me butterflies. We hung out yesterday and got pulled over while cruising. She got a ticket and all her weed thrown out , I felt so bad. Today, I asked her to hang out and I picked her up and we watched a movie at my house. I was so nervous, this girl is so beautiful. So we watch the whole movie , and on the way to her house we stop at my friends and smoke a joint. Chat for a bit and keep going. 

I couldn't help but continuously look back and forth at her and the road, she is so pretty and I won't get to see her for a bit. I pulled up and she jump over and kissed me for about twenty seconds. I was so shocked . I am happy for the first time in a long time. Even my last relationships, I don't recall a kiss that made that much of an impact on me . I just want this to work out so badly .
