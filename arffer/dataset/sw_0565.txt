How are men supposed to interact with women?

If all men are rapists; if it is creepy to talk to women in public, or in line, or on the street, if it can lead to sexual harassment in a workplace.

Any time you talk to a woman who you are interested in, on some level, you want sex.  People spend inordinate amounts of time shaming men who think about sex at all; if a guy asks out a girl, he is apparently just saying "would you like some dick" (we took the chris rock bit and perverted it to the point where all men are evil).

How am I supposed to interact with women if in interacting with women, and expressing my sexuality, I am a sexual predator; but if I don't, I'm a celibate chump who gets put in the "friend zone" for not explicitly mentioning sexual interest. Don't tell me these aren't real; people on this sub and elsewhere parrot those lines with alarming frequency. Explain it to me, beyond "just get it." It really seems you have to be perfect or you need to kill yourself, don't tell me about the outliers, they are only notable because they worked around the rule, found some magic person who wasn't stuck up their own ass.

I feel like people put me in a box and are now laughing at me. There is no logical way out of this besides death or isolation. I don't want "oh, just have manners, it's so easy" because clearly, the insults fly.  Don't lie.
