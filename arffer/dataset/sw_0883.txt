Lost all I cared about

So I grew up in a pretty fucked up house. Both my parents were doctors but my dad abused me, my brothers, and my mom. My mom stayed because she believes in "fixing" people and probably enjoys abuse, from what I can tell. She eventually broke up with him when I was 14 because she cheated on him, really after the 20th girl finally? My entire life I was just so excited for college to finally get away from my fucked up family and have some independence. Well freshman year was great, great friends, fun times, good grades. Sophomore year: easier classes so I decided on joining some clubs but then I had a panic attack and lost interest and focus in all my hobbies. I no longer enjoy lifting, swimming, walking, even my old love cooking. My friends tell me they don't get it since I look like I have everything I want. I don't know what career I want and it never got to me before. Now I can't stop feeling worthless, pointless, hopeless. I thought I had found my escape and I'm exhausted after withdrawing from college because I stopped being able to focus. I'm tired of fighting my dad and now fighting against my own desire to kill myself. Just tired of this shit. I have no more will anymore. I'm just gonna sleep for now and decide if these feelings will leave tomorrow but I really doubt it. Shit is bullshit. Everyone looks into my life and see a spoiled rich kid but don't see the fucking bullshit abuse and my friends are so lucky to have dads that taught them anything about sports, fixing shit around the house, some pride. All I got was punishment. Punishment for spilling water outside the tub when I was 5. Punishment for not being assertive in school. Punishment for letting kids push me around and being a "pussy". I have all the money I can want but never had parents teach me responsibility or how to socialize or how to confront someone except if you count yelling and using physical force
