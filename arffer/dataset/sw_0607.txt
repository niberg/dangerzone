I don't see a future

I am a freshmen in high school and my grades are already terrible I will probably not get in to college if I try. I have goals I have set but my own mother doesn't believe in me. I told her today that I want to make music when I grow up and she told me I would never be successful. My own mom doesn't help support my goals I set I don't see the point in living anymore.
