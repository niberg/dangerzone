How can I help others when I can't even help myself?

I'm a social worker who spends her free time looking up suicide methods. I was a half hour late today because I'm also an alcoholic who drinks to excess most nights. I'm terrified my mistake will cost me, even though my boss is not here today. How can I help others who have it so much worse than me if I can't even help myself?

I spent a week in a hospital in May because I wanted to kill myself because I had lost my boyfriend and sense of sanity. I don't want to go back there but every day just feels more hopeless. I absolutely would end everything if there was a way to do it without hurting those in my life, mainly my parents. Life goes on...but it just seems like it never gets better. thanks for reading.
