I never knew how suicide would have such an impact in my life until my Uncle took his life.

My uncle took his life several months ago. Before then, suicide was just something we knew about, but had no connection to. Once my uncle died, i saw how suicide can affect life's. I feel as if i underestimated its impact. My mom has taken his death the worst, and the recent story about the woman who voluntarily took her life in Oregon had her in tears. I feel as if i have learned a lesson on life with my uncles passing.
