People complaining about reposts are fucking pathetic

I'm sorry dude, I'm so sorry that I don't have time to trawl the last six months of posts of your precious subreddit to find out whether the piece of content I want to post has been posted before. I'm sorry that I don't spend four hours a day idly browsing this one particular corner of the Internet and haven't seen all the content in the world. 

Honestly, if you have ever complained about a repost, you need to just fuck off. The majority of readers of a subreddit do not visit it regularly enough to identify reposts, and chances are that your comment about something being a repost is being more annoying to more people than the repost itself, so fuck off.
