Why is making icons that have no words or tooltips not illegal and punishable by death?

This is especially true of most native Mac apps, but any app on any OS can be a culprit here. Crappy. On Macs it's like a "rule" of some kind for native apps, but some developers break away from this and (thankfully) put tooltips in anyway, because: fuck that ugly-ass shit.
I don't like it. Making me click something to figure out what it does, only to have it delete something, post something without a prompt, or fucking open my facebook page is NOT ok. 

This goes for context in general. I'm looking at YOU, GarageBand. Guilty, guilty, guilty.  I'm a very careful person. I don't WANT to fucking click the icon. I want to carefully hover. And then I want a tooltip. Or anything else that would possibly give me a hint as to what it will do before I press it. Or for christ sakes, just make the button a little bigger and put a fucking WORD on it. It's not like it was taking up that much space in the first place. Yes, even on mobile. No, I don't mind.   Oh, and if I click it, and nothing visible happens, guess what? I've learned NOTHING and you still SUCK. 

And before you even think about posting some pathological sample which shows how wrong I am to desire this thing, or point to some research that says "oh, this is fucking better or more efficient" or some nonsense, remember this one simple truth: No, it isn't! Why? because I will stop every 30 seconds to rage about how much I hate it, that's why! it wastes a LOT of time!

And fuck you, playstation!  I want to tell someone one syllable words when explaining what sequence of buttons to press, and type one letter when writing it. A B X Y, Not "triangle, rectangle, circle, two perpendicular intersecting lines".   And no it's not an X. An X is slightly non-perpendicular unless you're a 3 year old.  And it's not a square, because, well, Fuck Q.  

In conclusion, either put a tooltip or use a word, or I will murder you in your sleep.
