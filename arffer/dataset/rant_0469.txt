I hate people who eat cheap chocolate!

Seriously. You're not supposed to eat a bar of chocolate each week. It's not a good thing that it basically tastes like sugar blocks with chocolate flavoring.

Buy good chocolate once a month. Good, dark, organic, fair trade chocolate. DO NOT CHEW IT. Let it sit in your mouth and melt.

It's common sense, not something magically bestowed upon you by some higher power. If you can't afford good chocolate once a month, then you're not going to miss out on all that extra sugar from the cheap bars anyway.
