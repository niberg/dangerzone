I want to kill myself in a week.

I want to kill myself next week on the 19th. Two years ago I lost the thing I treasured the most so I would love more than anything for my death to fall on that date. 

I don't feel any reason to enumerate my reasons. I know what they are. And even though we all harbor some kind of psychic pain, a fact we can all relate to, the pain we all individually have is of a unique strain so as to block outsiders from ever really accessing it. Or so I think. At least for myself..I can say that there are many things that are very similar to what others from here go through so as to be almost clich√©...the most important thing is that I am, and have been, and can only foresee being, in constant and excruciating mental, emotional, and physical pain. Nothing special, right?

I am tormented every conscious minute of my life. A slight exaggeration,  but only slight. I dread waking up the next door and the mere existence of a tomorrow os terrifying. On some level I feel almost like an ingrate for hating life so much. Even though I may hate myself and my life, it's not that I don't think I deserve to be happy. I think it would take a lot for someone to NOT deserve happiness. But that thought, like many others,  simply does not jive with reality...

To the ultimate end of suicide I am not in a good position. My most viable option is the classic wrist-clashing but I know it's a BAD idea. Atrocious, actually. But I don't have the luxury of good ideas at this point. Underneath all this emotional instability I have a logical core which has prevented me from doing anything unless it had a guaranteed success rate which as you know doesn't exist. But I feel like it's time to shed that.

I'm not scared that I'll do anything. I'm scared that I won't.
