Believe it or fucking not, I have not tried every fucking wine in the store

I work at a liquor store and little did I know before I started this job, but apparently it's my responsibility to know how every fucking wine and product in the store tastes. Some stupid bitch came up to me the other day, "How does this malbec compare to this garnacha?". Kudos to you if you have even ever heard of those two types of wine, and this bitch comes up to me expecting me to know how they compare. I straight up said to her, "I've never had either of those wines". And months ago this little shit fuck comes in and starts asking me about a wine we just got in, and I told him I really couldn't answer his questions to which this fuck says, "You mean they don't tell you anything about this wine?" That's fucking correct cock sucker, they didn't tell me a fucking thing about that wine or any of the other fucking wines in this store. These fucking people, when they go to the super market do they go around asking employees about how to brands of eggs compare?!?! These people need to use their fucking heads and fucking google this shit and stop assuming that I know how every fucking thing in the store tastes.
