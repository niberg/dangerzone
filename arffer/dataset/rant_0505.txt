It makes me mad when people say "a relationship without sex is just a friendship."

It hurts my feelings a lot when I browse r/sex or r/relationships and so many people seem to think that in 100% of cases, a relationship - sex = friendship. I understand sex is absolutely critically important to some people's relationships, which is fine. I was just surprised so many people felt like this was the ONLY right way.

But it really makes me feel like MY relationship is invalid. My SO and I are both entirely asexual. We have been together for 5 years. We live together, have pets together. We sleep in the same bed and cuddle each other every night. We affectionately hold hands, kiss each other, and just enjoy being close to one another.

He is not "a friend." We are in love. We go on romantic dates. We intend to be together always. One day, we'll get married. Then, we will raise a family together. Our kids will grow up with me and him as mommy and daddy, raising them as a unit. They will be raised by two parents who so clearly love each other very much.

But we are "just friends" because we do not have sex? We're not going to have sex either, until we decide to have a child (unless we choose to adopt). People just do not understand that some people can be totally happy in a relationship such as mine.

I thought most people don't agree with that statement, but it seems to be everywhere. I think views on relationship dynamics like this are completely subjective, but others don't seem to. It hurts.
