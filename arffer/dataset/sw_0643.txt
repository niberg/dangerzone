Wife is leaving, plans on taking my child. The situation isn't normal, and I don't know how to deal with this

My wife says she's leaving me, but she'll still be living with me for another month while she finishes school.  In the mean time, I'm expected to feed/cloth/and supply her with whatever as she's not had a job since our relationship started (which I was fine with as she was a stay at home mom).  But now I don't know what to do, I want us to work but she doesn't want to hear it.

I think about ending it every day.  How to do it, where to do it, the least painful way to do it.  But, every time I think of my son I can't stand the thought of him growing up without a father and I also can't stand the thought of never seeing my son.

TL:DR
Wife is leaving, i contemplate suicide daily, but can't make myself do it while i have my son to think about.  Looking for a way to cope.
