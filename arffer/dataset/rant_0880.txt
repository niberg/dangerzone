How dare you call me lasy!

Are you fucking kidding me. You walk into our store. The store myself, the other girl and our manager have been running for almost a year. Just because our manager is trying to move up in his career. 

You come in as manager. Yes I know you used to manage this store, but that was years ago. It was your desicion to leave. It was your own fault.

You come in and instantly tell the other girl that you feel intimidated by how much I know about YOUR job.
I'm sorry but when our manager moved to the store a week before we had a new manager, who had to run this place? Who acted as a 2ic even though I wasn't trained as one? Me.

I put all my time and effort into this store, I fucking love that little store. All my regulars. Its great. Then you came along.

I know I applied for the 2ic role at the other small store. By my choice and by encouragement from our old manager. He supported my choice. He was the best. You have the guts to say to me that you don't want me to think that people are talking about me.

Then what do you do? You go behind my back and call me lasy, to the manager of the store I'm covering at because hey, I fucking care about this company and if I can help stores out who are understaffed, I'll leave home at 4am for a 7am start if I have to.

But you tell her you think I'm not suited for a 2ic role. You think I'm too lazy. Bitch, the reason you think I'm llasy is because when you came here, you told the other girl I needed to step DOWN. So I did. And all because I started putting something away when you wanted me to do something else. Did you tell me? No.

I am so glad I am leaving that store now. Already. You've lost one regular customer. I can't see the other girl staying there much longer either.

Good job.
