My sister was born in a barn

She's so inconsiderate of others space and belongings. She'll constantly borrow my stuff without asking and I'll have to go digging to find it, and usually when she grabs stuff she'll leave the rejected items everywhere. She'll barge in without knocking and then get pissed at me for being upset that she did so. I just got back after the weekend to find clothes all over the bed, my bathroom stuff scattered every which way and she clearly didn't close the door because the dog got in and rolled all over the pillows. I almost want to be a fly on the wall when she goes off to college, tries to pull this shit and then get bitched out at.
