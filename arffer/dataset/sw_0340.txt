Ex considering suicide... internet relationship, unable of how to help

Hello all,

I have an ex that I still talk to occasionally and recently they have been going through an extreme wave of depression. Very very severe. There was no apparent cause, this was the reason we broke up. Recently they talked about why should even keep trying, why should care about his life when is just going to kill himself during high school, wants to get hit by a truck, etc.....

This is an internet relationship. There is only an extent of what I can do to help, I feel useless/helpless being unable to do much of anything.  I just need some help, or something... thank you for reading.
