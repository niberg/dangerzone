Want me to help you pay for that head-ass extraction procedure?

Found this little stinker on my Facebook news feed several days ago, courtesy of an aquatic-biology "student" who *should* know better.

Yeah...no, buddy. Let's break this down.

--The AZA is *not* some sort of external watchdog organization--it's essentially a trade group. In other words: this is an entirely self-policed industry. Of *course* these folks aren't going to hold their member organizations to sufficiently stringent standards--that would constitute a direct blow to their business model. Often, wildlife parks continue to operate under substandard/abusive conditions for *years* until animal-welfare groups intervene. Regardless of any token efforts and/or policies on paper, this organization represents a fundamentally cruel industry. There is simply no humane way to confine an orca to captivity.

--No, puppy-mill dogs aren't "generated" in China. (What, do you think they're spawned industrially in test-tubes?) Au contraire--this industry is (quite *literally*) mired in our own backyards, amid nearly non-existent USDA "regulation" (noticing a pattern here?). For that matter...try stepping back and taking a second look at your argument. Do you *really* think that the frontrunners of these campaigns; the folks behind the documentaries and investigative reports; the people who dedicate careers and regularly risk life-and-limb to spread awareness, are the ones impulsively purchasing "designer dogs" in their spare time?

--And finally...advocacy needn't operate on a sliding scale. The plight of factory-farmed livestock and hunted dolphin populations shouldn't detract from the urgency of this particular cause. Clearly, Rome wasn't built in a day--though captive orcas constitute just *one* battleground in the fight for animal welfare, they are nevertheless an integral piece of the puzzle.

I understand that you're emotionally invested in your job and coworkers...but sometimes, we need to put aside our personal biases and acknowledge the error of our ways. Fact is, you're becoming an industry shill--and no amount of cutesy sea-creature emojis can mitigate that.
