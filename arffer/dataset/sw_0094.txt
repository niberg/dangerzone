I want to be myself, but feel restricted

I am 14 years old and male,  I live in a household with a father and mother with a sister in college.

My parents raised me Christian, but I am an atheist.  If they found out I was, they would most likely want to disown me as soon as they get a chance.  Lots of relatives would want nothing to do with me if they knew as well, just like an old man in our family who has a mental disorder.

I do well in school, I'm usually in the A- B+ area.  I have been able to make friends and participate in various activities with them.  It's just I feel like I'm not able to be who I want to be.

I want to have fun, enjoy life, etc. but it comes down to my parents once again.  If they found out I was chatting online over a multiplayer game or if I said to them I didn't want to go to church, they would for sure make my life worse to the point of wanting to mutilate myself.

Frankly, they need to know that the online community I am talking about isn't full of 30 year old pedophiles, because almost all of them are my age.  Plus, maybe I actually have a brain and don't believe in a book from the fantasy genre.  I just want to be myself.

I know my parents do their job as parents, but there is a point to where it becomes overprotective.  I'm 14, not 8.

Any help I can get is appreciated.  I just need consulting on what I can do to overcome my issue.
