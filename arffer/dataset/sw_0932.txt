Thought that I should post here...

So, I'm not sure what is going on with me.  Over the past couple years, I have been spiraling down a bad path.  I just can't get myself to do things anymore, with friends, family, or anyone for that matter.  I'm a 16 year old male, with a bit below average looks I guess.  I had excellent grades, but I can't even get myself to do homework or projects anymore, my body just doesn't let me.  I guess that I just may need someone to talk to.  As previously stated, I don't necessarily want to kill myself, I just want to die.  if I was told that i wouldn't wake up tomorrow, I don't think that I would have too much of a problem with that.
