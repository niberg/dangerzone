I Fucking Told YOU!!!

I told you weeks...no MONTHS ago that we needed to make sure to keep a tight hold on this "thing" in order to prevent the cluster fuck that happened last time.  

I warned you two months ago that giving away the free "things" would be a risk to the "thing".

I told you last week that we can't take anymore orders, and what did you tell me? "I won't turn away money".  I know were in the business of making money but we have nothing more sell and there is NO MORE ROOM.  You were told by someone else what the limit was and you just blew them off.

Now that we're at the 11th hour you finally realize OMG this is too big what are we going to do??  Well maybe if you had fucking listened to me and everyone else telling you THERE'S A LIMIT we, no no no YOU (because this isn't my problem, I'm just gonna keep taking the money like you told me) would be freaking out at the last minute.  But hey you got your money.  The party will be a fiasco but you got your few extra hundred dollars.  I hope it was fucking worth it.
