Who throws shit in an office?!

So, I build models. I enjoy it. Makes life a little bit better. Makes me happy. I decide to put them on a shelf at my IT place. It's at a University. We get your computers clean free of charge. It's nice. Anyway, I decide to bring them in and put them on a shelf. People talk about them, how nice they are. I come into my office, and find them in broken with pieces MISSING. Two co workers throw a STRESSBALL of all things around and nail them. They don't tell me before hand, they don't say sorry, they don't do shit until I come in and discover it. These models I built were expensive, and to find them destroyed just kills me. You better believe I'm grasping at that fucking stressball now. Plus, some guys are having trouble OPENING A DOOR next door and they won't stop fucking up! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?! And then some asshole comes in looking for directions and I explain in great detail how to get to where he needs to go, and he fucking doesn't listen and acts rude. Plus I failed a test. Rant over.
