Struggling through days.

If I'm honest, I think at least once a day that everything would be better if I were dead. I left a job to study, I lost a bunch of weight and I keep expecting some big revelation where everything'll be good from then on. It hasn't been. I meet new people who I really click with and then suddenly they just go distant and I can't see why.

There's nobody around for me to talk to about it. I have some friends but they're all having so much trouble themselves that I can't bring myself to heap my problems on them as well. I was worried about hurting my family but I barely see them now and I somehow think that not wanting to upset my mom is probably the only reason I don't do anything.

I don't see anything changing. I'm entering a field that is already full of graduates and I doubt I am impressive enough to find a decent job. I can't seem to make any new friends and my old ones are too busy. On top of that my savings ran out and I am cresting towards being completely broke.

I just need to say something to someone.
