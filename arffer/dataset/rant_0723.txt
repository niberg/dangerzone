Why can't my goddamn girlfriend just understand technology JESUS CHRIST.

I work for a phone company and I'm about to switch my phone service over to them because I get a 75% discount as an employee, and my discount also covers spouses, so I'm putting my girlfriend on my plan, saving us both a bunch of money. So, I plan on getting an iPhone 6 (currently have a 4) and I asked her if she also wants one (she currently has a 4s), to which she has been replying 'I don't care'. Well, I'm not just gonna get her an expensive ass phone if she doesn't care, so I asked her what other phone she thinks she might want, and she said,'I don't know. I don't want one thinner my 4s because i put it in my back pocket and I don't want to sit on it and break it'. I told her that's not really an option, all new smartphones are pretty goddamn thin, because technology has just gone that way, that doesn't make them more breakable. Also, if you don't want to sit on your phone and break it, then don't put in your back pocket. BUt no, she wouldn't have it. She said,'That's just what I do. I put it in my backpocket, and then I forget it's there and get all worried when I can't find it, and then it's in my back pocket, so I want a thick phone'.

THAT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE. IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT BREAKING YOUR FUCKING PHONE BY DOING WHAT YOU DO, THEN STOP DOING IT, AND YOU CAN'T KEEP THAT PHONE IF YOU WANT TO BE ON MY PLAN, IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. JUST PICK ANY GODDAMN PHONE.

I don't know why she thinks that new phones are somehow structurally weaker. PLus, she cracked the screen on her phone the day she got it just by, as she puts it, setting on her nightstand. Now that I think about it, maybe she doesn't need a nice phone because she handles them like shit. I just don't understand how any young person in this day and age doesn't have at least a mild grasp of technology, especially phones. Fucking drives me insane.
