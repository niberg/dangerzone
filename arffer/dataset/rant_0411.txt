My coworker

I've never entered a rant, but she is ruining my days at work. 

I'm considered a very laid back guy, I never talk about people. I mean from time to time I'll have to vent about something that happened like everyone does but it's rare.

So my coworker has been on a gossip rampage lately. I haven't heard any direct comments about me but I know she is talking about me when I leave the room because a few times I've walked in and they immediately stop talking and I can just feel the tension in the room.

I used to love my job, but the last few months I've had the urge to tell her to shut the fuck up. I've even day dreamed about quitting all epic like. 

Has anyone ever had this problem and if so how can I make my days more pleasant?
