People getting pissed off over jokes..

I hate when people find that they have to get mad when someone jokes about something, sure, if they're directing something insulting towards YOU, you can get pissed off, but, if I make a joke about black people, I don't need every black person to sit there telling me it's racist, that's the fucking point, I'M MAKING FUN OF RACISM. When people slag Irish for being alcoholics, I laugh, I'm not gonna say 'herp derp thats nert truhh' because THEY ALREADY KNOW ITS NOT TRUE, OTHERWISE THEY'D BE IDIOTS.

When someone makes a joke - they KNOW it's not true, hence it being called a joke, if I was to say 'all black people are slaves', that would anger a lot of people, but, why? I KNOW all black people AREN'T slaves, I understand the history, but, if the human race cannot make light of the past, I really don't want to imagine our future. 

I know I've based this on black people a lot, and, that's literally just because the recent encounter (about 60 seconds ago) was based on a racist joke towards black people, and, it wasn't even bad.. My name on a server was 'Nigl3t' and some kid absolutely raged - calm down, it's a joke.. I respect everybody who respects me, regardless of race, religion, nationality etc.. I don't hate you, but, I'm sure as hell going to insult the fuck out of specific people.

I have a friend - Hassan - he's Egyptian. I call him a suicide bomber on a daily basis, I'm from a rough part of Ireland, he calls me a junkie, it's fucking funny.
