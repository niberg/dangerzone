Fuck Moviefone.

Granted it is useful for finding times and locations for the movies I want to see. Why is it that I can watch ten commercials and not have a buffering problem once, but I can't get through one fucking trailer without it pausing to buffer even though the grey "buffer bar" shows that It shouldn't be buffering. Also fuck that local storage box that comes up, I practically have to stand on the left click to deny the fucking thing because, quite frankly, you can't trust any fucking thing anymore.
