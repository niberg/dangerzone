F U Deviant Art!!!

I got a poster for my birthday over the summer from a friend. He bought me a 20x30. Framing the poster wasn't on my list of top shit to do till today. I went to the local art shop, bought a 20x30 poster frame only to learn Deviant Art doesn't feel obligated to sell you what you paid for. The poster has 3 inch borders on it. So the art is actually 23x33. Who the f carries that sized frame and why the f would I want to drop an arm and a leg on custom framing a reprinted poster?! And even if I did buy custom framing the actual print is like 23x30. I am so pissed off. I have creepy property investors coming in like cockroaches to crawl around my apartment and value it for purchase. It finally gave me an excuse to put up my political art. Now I am stuck with a $27 frame I already opened, a piece of useless sized art, and essentially more useless clutter in my home. And don't get me started on the actual Deviant website. I can't actually browse artists on there anymore without them hi-jacking my browser with ads every few minutes... 

I'm not even a member of that site and hate hate hate them. 
FUCK YOU, DEVIANT ART.
