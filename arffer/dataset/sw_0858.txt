Finally going to have peace.

I've come to the conclusion that my life will never get better. And honestly, I've accepted it. Some people just aren't meant to be happy, sadly, I'm one of those people. I have a rare genetic metabolic disorder (TMAU) that no matter how many times I shower, I still smell bad.


I'll be straight up and say if I didn't have this condition my life would be amazing. I had a job I loved, great social life, and a nice body from going to the gym 6 days a week. But this condition has fucked me up so bad - mentally, physically and emotionally.


It's debilitating hearing comments from complete strangers about how bad I smell, it's not like I willingly choose to smell bad. I would honestly give up one of my limbs if it meant that I could live a normal life. And that's why I'm done.


There's no cure for this and I have no quality of life worth living. All I do is sitting at home (I still live at home at 23) and just watch Netflix and YouTube videos. It angers me that had I not had this condition, I would be a regular happy dude who would be in a relationship, having sex, living on my own, have my own car.


But no, I was robbed of a normal life. So I'm just done. Tired of it all. I've already determined to kill myself tonight just to finally get rid of the pain.
