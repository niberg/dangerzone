21 thinking about using for the first time in 3 years, and fed up with my job.

I work at a job in which I get paid minimum wage to take care of the developmentally disabled. My coworkers are abusive and lazy and frequently fail to show up to work entirely. When that happens I end up picking up the slack because if the slack isn't picked up my clients truly suffer because THEY CAN'T FUCKING CARE FOR THEMSELVES! To make matters worse one of my clients is essentially a rapist who molests the other clients constantly, and another is unable to communicate exept by crying as loud as she possibly can. The worst coworker I have just so happens to be my ex and I work the majority of my days with her. Just fyi we broke up because she's a manic bipolar who wasn't in a good place right now, which turned out to be code for: I wanna fuck your friends. Anyways I'm fucking done with this shit. I fantasize about relapsing constantly and giving up the 3 years I've struggled to get clean off of a plethera of drugs.
