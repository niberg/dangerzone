Ever realize how fucking stupid flirting is?

This isn't really an angry rant, more frustrated and annoying. 

I really don't like flirting, not the idea of it, not the practice of it, not the constant "Is this girl flirting with me? Should I ask?" that I get whenever I'm around someone who's attractive and being nice to me. 

Whenever I figure out that someone **was** flirting with me, it's always super late, and I completely miss my chance. and even then, we have that mindset that guys need to make the first *obvious* move, and I'm not that confident I don't want to misread a signal and lose a decent friend because my dick wanted an answer. 

And then there's me when I'm flirting. 

First off, I don't really flirt, if I'm around someone I enjoy to be around I'll try and make them happy, crack jokes, compliment them etc. It's not intended to be flirting but apparently it seems like it. And then if you look around at guys who actually flirt, most of them are complete scumbags, so when I try to flirt all I can think about is this person thinking "Oh my god, another perv." 

It's frustrating as hell to have confidence issues and try and find someone you want to be with. You make excuses so you don't risk hearing an "Oh I'm sorry, I don't think of you that way." or see a creeped out expression on their face. 

I have no problems with any of my girl-friends, they're all lovely individuals who I enjoy to be around. But the second I start thinking of them in a different way it's like i've committed some strange taboo.

All I want is an option where you can be direct and not risk something. Why is it that I feel like if I go "Hey want to go out?" with a friend and they say no I have to run and hide, but at the same time I know if they do it to me and I say no I won't see them any differently, atleast not in a negative aspect.
