FUCK YOU BOSS

My boss is really making my life a fucking living hell. Everyday at work,  my stomach hurts every time he open his stupid mouth because I might be the next victim of all the bullshit that flows like a stream from his mouth.

Just 1 hour ago  he came rushing in the office and said (or yelled) WE NEED A QUICK MEETING SIT DOWN! Then he sat at my desk  and yelled "WHY THE HELL ARE YOU SO MESSY I CAN'T EVEN SIT HERE" after him just being fucking annoying for 2 minutes he finally tells me "you need to do this, bla bla bla" and I told him, and I quote "No problem, one thing at a time, I will just finish this other important thing first and I will start this right after" and then this fucking idiot just explodes "WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? TELL ME WHY YOU HAVE THE NEED TO SAY THAT? HAVE I TOLD YOU TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW? NO, THEN WHY THE FUCK DO YOU SAY THAT?" and all I could say was that I just wanted to keep him informed on which order I will do my tasks so he knows when he can expect it to be finished and that I didn't know what the hell I did wrong... He screamed for about 5 minutes after that, stopped only when I left in tears. Now he is sitting on his chair, sending me "I hate you" looks and just being a fucking annoying, incompetent prick.. Sorry for the long rant.
