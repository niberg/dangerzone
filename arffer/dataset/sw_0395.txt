Tired

I'm fairly certain I'm going to buy a cheap high caliber handgun asap and see how it feels to put in my mouth. I don't want it to be an emotional teary eyed decision. If I do it, it'll be with a heart rate close to resting and I'll be totally decided. Over the past few years the idea of ending my life has been one of my most comforting thoughts. 

The why's are typical: I feel disconnected from people in general. I feel pretty nothing worthwhile most of the time, and when I do feel it's sadness accompanied by throbbing of the chest. I'd say it's like a 60-30-10 of nothing, sads, and feeling normal respectively. When I look into the future I can't see any changes in my life that would make me feel otherwise. I tried exercise and hobbies which I do as a means of passing time but the feeling and craving is always still there.

Anyways, it's been close to a decade of this shitty situation and if you could make some suggestions I'm open to them. Thanks!
