Feminism gets really stupid sometimes.

I can now see why some women are saying they aren't feminists and don't need feminism. I thought I was one because I want women in other countries to have what I have. There are still women who can't vote, own property, choose a career, choose who to marry, or make independent choices about their reproductive status. I want all women to have what I get automatically for being born a white female in a first world country. But no, apparently I am not a feminist because I refused to pick apart a tv show and agree that it was sexist (and I will never think Doctor Who is sexist until something blatant happens, like the Doctor calling Clara a cunt or something). I said that I enjoy the show, don't think it's sexist, and can't see why we'd spend all of our time picking apart a tv show when there are women in other countries who don't even have rights. I got banned for making a "dismissive comment". Screw you feminists. You made me embarrassed to count myself as one of you yesterday.
