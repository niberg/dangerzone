Co-Worker is a DUMBASS.

FUCKING SHIT MAN. We've been working together for like 6 months already and every month, everyone has to give me a list of expenses they blew. There's a certain format they have to follow to make things easier and smoother. I've taught her how to do it 3 times! I gave her the format and everything so that she doesn't need to make her own file! BUT EVEN UNTIL NOW SHE STILL DOESN'T FOLLOW IT. She's a 37 year-old woman, and I'm just a college drop out. DID YOU NOT LEARN HOW TO USE EXCEL? DID I NOT TEACH YOU RIGHT?
