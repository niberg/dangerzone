No, I am not coming home. SO STOP FUCKING ASKING!

My dad just phoned me at the shelter and asked if I was coming home for Thanksgiving. He, and the rest of my family live in California. I'm currently stuck in DC. I intend to spend this Nov. 27th eating a turkey at 8th and I,then watching the Silent Drill Team perform. After which I'll grab a beer and walk over to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and watch the guard for the rest of the evening, then  do some coke and go to bed.. I am not spending money I don't have to come home and listen to people mindlessly bitch about shit.
