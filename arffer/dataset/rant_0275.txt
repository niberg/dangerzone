I want to talk about Lena Dunham

Why is it a 'thing' to like Lena Dunham? Why is she a role model? What do people *get* from her? I don't understand. 

Let's start with the fact that she made a rape allegation where she was supposedly too drunk for consent. She describes the incident as the man only being 'semi erect'- yet she was sore for weeks afterwards. How does that work? And how does it work that she was 'raped' when she didn't tell him no- *but* talked dirty to him, invited him to  her place, and when she finally *did* tell him no- he left? Not to mention, this man was also high and drunk, and supposedly in a worse state as he couldn't even recall the events the next day and she *could*. 

....so how is *he* the rapist? 

But say this is rape- it's really funny that Lena has nothing against rape jokes as she has once stated "Rape jokes are okay if you're female." When it came to putting Daniel Tosh under fire for making rape jokes.

Lena has made public derogatory remarks about other celebrity's personas or appearances, but it's not okay for *other people* to do the same to her, or they're misogynists. Why?  

She openly admits to violating her sister through passages in her navel gazing book via "bribing her with candy for kisses on the lips", "reaching into my underwear to figure something out as she lied next to me" and even explicitly, verbatim stating about her sister "Like a suburban sexual predator anything to woo a small girl I was trying" which brings me to my next point. 

**Lena Dunham compares herself to a sexual predator in her memoir.**

When these exact words by Lena are quoted on truth revolt, Lena is in an outrage and threatens to sue the website. For accusing her of sexual abuse.

**What the hell**? **How does this woman have a fan base**? 

She also proclaims that she is a feminist, but *can't even protect other women from her alleged 'rapist' because she refuses to partake in an investigation where she concisely remembers every specific detail about her 'rapist' and the situation**. 

I don't hate. I've never hated another human in my life. I don't think people are ugly. **But Lena Dunham is a very ugly woman. And I hate her**. 

I don't hate her because she's a woman. I don't think she threatens me. I don't hate her because she's successful. I don't hate her because she's fat. 

*Lena Dunham, I hate you because you make me ashamed to be a female. You mock real victims of rape and sexual assault. You are a privileged woman and you are not funny, smart, or forward thinking. You still entertain the thinking that women are weak, feminists are hypocrites, and shock value makes you artistic*.
