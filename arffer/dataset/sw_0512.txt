I think I'm ready to die.

I'm homeless.  All the people I've grown to love have left me.  I'm angry, too angry to function as a normal human being anymore.

No, that's not why.  The real reason I'm ready to die is because I am sick.  I am an able-bodied young man receiving disability for a mental disorder.  An "invisible illness" people have taken to calling it.  It's this illness that has proven to me that I should not be alive.

Sure, I have plenty to live for.  Plenty.  I can think of many things to live for.  Things I want to live for.  Some things I *must* live for.  Although, I can't.  I can no longer stand to be alive.  These things for which I live are not enough to dull the pain of being alive.  I don't want to be alive.  None of it matters to my brain.  The brain is a tool which we've evolved to use as a means for survival... and yet mine is telling me not to survive.  Do not survive.  Do not reproduce.  End the bloodline.

I've been told that it's only serious if you have a plan.  I don't have a plan.  Does that mean I'm not worth helping?  Where is the help I was promised?  It never came.  

If you could walk a mile in my shoes, I'd ask that you didn't.  Once you put these shoes on, you can't take them off.
