Inalienable right to life!

Why at this point in human history do we not have the inalienable right to life? As in, food, utilities, shelter and health care.  
Imagine a world where you could focus on bettering yourself and the world around you because you never got that shitty job just to afford that shitty place to live.   
You wouldn't it be nice as a child, knowing that you could follow your dreams without becoming homeless? Or as an adult, that all you can focus on is job security so you don't make ends meet?
I know I am still young(33) but I see so many people older then me having troubles keeping there heads a float and work jobs they shouldn't be doing all to make ends meet.  
  
I for one am working towards a goal of self sustainability and only plan on making money so I don't have to worry about it anymore. I feel as if I am not alone in feeling this way.  
I have a dream that one day, humanity works together and realizes that we are all working towards similar goals and no matter who you are, you DESERVE a hand full of inalienable human rights.
