Look at that loser over there in corner with the unexplained bruises who never talks to anyone and only reads Harry Potter

Oh yeah, nothing wrong there she's just some freak. She wears long sleeves in the heat because she's weird or probably some cutter freak. God, is she reading Harry Potter again? Why can't she just grow up? Ugh...why won't she take a shower or brush her hair? Doesn't she now she's gross. Whatever, lets dump her desk out and kick her stuff around. Look, she's walking home with her little brother and sister, lets throw ice at them. Losers deserve it. No way, I have to work with her? Great, she never has any of the stuff we need for our project and for some weird reason she can't come to my house. Says she has to watch her little brother and sister, she's probably lying I'll just tell the teacher she's not doing any work. Not allowed to go to people's houses or have people over? Nothing amiss there, nothing I as an educator have been trained to look out for. Good, she's moving on to high school, hope she doesn't ruin graduation. Who's that lady screaming at her? Who cares not my problem...

Sorry, just had to get that off my chest. Nobody ever wonders why the weird kid is weird in the first place. Nobody wonders why someone would spend every waking moment trying to escape into the wizarding world. Nobody wonders why the weird kid wears unfashionable ill fitting clothes day in and day out. Nobody wonders why somebody would come into school day in and day out without bathing or grooming, everyone is allowed to do these things right? 

Sorry about the wall of text, I'm in my twenties now and I've been holding this holding this in for years.
