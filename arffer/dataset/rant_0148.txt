Two rants in one! Potty train your kids and wait your turn in line!!

As a parent it is YOUR job to make sure your kid knows how to use a public restroom!! I did not enjoy walking into my job's bathroom today to a TURD ON THE FLOOR. If your kid can't sit on the toilet, your kid shouldn't be in a public restroom without you!

If you see a cashier checking someone out, it is NOT okay to walk up and interrupt them to ask a question! It's rude to the customer I am helping at the moment, please just wait a minute so I can give you my full attention when I'm done ringing them up!

Retail, ugh, I hate you this time of year!
