Happy rant to my ex who left me for another guy

I just want to thank you, since we've been done I've been worlds happier with my new girlfriend. In the 5 months since we broke up you've gone through 2 or 3 different guys, I've been with the same girl for 4 months. She's 1,000 times better than you in every way. She actually treats me well. I'm happy in this relationship whereas you are now lonely and severely depressed and probably wishing you had never fucked me over and done shit behind my back. Despite how good I was to you and put up with all your bullshit and was always there for you, you couldn't help but go looking for someone else,all the while lying to me about it. The karma you have been served is probably the sweetest thing I have ever witnessed. Thank you, I hate you. :)
