Coworker confessed serious suicidal things.

Background:
I date a coworker (L) in a different department who is friends with the person I work most closely with (D). D and I get along fine but we are not close and I have noticed a change in our relationship the past month or so, but I assumed it was me not her. 

So my boyfriend, L, told me that D confessed wanting to hurt herself to him today. They were talking about general coworker nonsense when she started going on about how she wants to harm herself. She elaborated to explain how her young children would still get financial support from some program through her husbands work. She also showed him the scars on her wrist from when she was a teen and explained how she was trying to follow a vein. She then asked L what he thought happened to people after they died and how her friend recently had a cardiac arrest said it was blissful while they were technically dead. L didn't know what to do initially but listened and told me shortly after D went home.

Its a small town and D's dad happens to be my landlord and live near her. I called my landlord and left a message saying to call me back, its about D. He called back but I was out of service and he left a message. As I was calling back again L decided to talk since he was the actual one she told. D's mom answered the phone and was very skeptical and somewhat dismissive. 

I'm not sure what to do from here. I know there are guns in her house, but I also know she is rarely alone because she has kids and a husband living with her. I don't want to tip her off that L told me. L is afraid D's mom is going to make some off-handed comment about everything and D will withdraw from reaching out to him.
