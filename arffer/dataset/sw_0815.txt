I do not belong.

Do you ever get the feeling you just don't belong? That one feeling in the back of your head when you're the geek in a room full of jocks. It's in human nature to want to be accepted, to be a part of the norm. I can't remember the last time I've experienced that feeling, that moment which could brighten up the darkest nights. After being on this planet for 19 years now I don't feel I belong. I am different. Even in those when I do accomplish something great and meaningful, I don't feel anything. Not bad. Not good. Just a sound echoing through a building with no one to listen. It's almost as if I'm a different species when I try to relate with others. I constantly have the urge to look at mirrors for long periods of time to ensure that its a person looking back at me. In the most non biased manner I can objectively give, I do not think of myself as unattractive. Middle of the pack at best. It's not that I do not receive attention from others, it just never feels genuine. I don't belong. I also don't think I'm original in any manner. I browse reddit and take ideas from different perspectives and generate an idea from this hivemind. It's similar to the function of a chameleon. I adapt to the information surrounding me, but it isn't me. It's just a collaboration of everyone else. Suicide is a constant, but not immediate thought. Death is terrifying. The middle man of pain and suffering is what makes it difficult to approach. Ceasing to exist would be the optimal conclusion.

Thank you for reading. Any comments would be welcome and appreciated.
