Time is standing still and I'm wasting it

A lot of things have gone right in my life, I'm just not feeling like myself. I was admitted to a hospital when I was 15 and wasn't released until I was almost 17. I used to go for jogs and exercise but I've gotten so out of shape and its affecting  my life in the worst ways possible. I can't get motivated, i have no friends no one I can talk to, no money to go to a gym or a rec  center, I work but it's stand still unfulfilling work, I'm so lost and feel at a stand still and that I'm wasting everyone's time, I'm probably doing now.
