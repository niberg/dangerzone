Nobody cares.

My friends don't even notice me anymore. My family never talks to me. People don't even look at me unless they have to. I am utterly alone and unwanted.

I really want to just stay in my room for the rest of the month, just to see if my friends would notice. I can guarantee you that my phone probably won't receive a single text message.
