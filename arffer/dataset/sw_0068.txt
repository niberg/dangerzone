Suicidal Thoughts

I am now 15 and I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for 4 years now. They constantly follow me around like a dark cloud and I can't seem to shake them as much as I used to be able to. I usually distract myself by drawing, singing, playing guitar, etc. (I am a very arty person) but there are those occasions where I do self mutilate (they are not often but they are there). The point is, they're still there and they're getting worse. I don't think I will act on them but I have in the past and I really don't want to but I think I might. I have spoken to people about it and I have a psychologist but she never gives me any ideas to help me. Do any of you have any ideas on how I can reduce them?
