no passion

I don't know what to do with my life anymore. It seems I am never satiated. When I am around people all the time, I feel happy but ignore my goals/obligations. When I am alone, I get things done but think about killing myself. There is no happy medium, I'm either anxious or depressed. I don't know what the fuck to do. There's a time and place to rely on friends but it can't be every fucking day. It seems everyone around me is moving forward and I'm just working and laying around. I have no passion, no desire to go back to school, no desire to get another job or start doing art again. I just don't get what any of it is for, it's all bullshit meant to pass the time until we finally kick it.
