I'm a dick when I don't give you some of MY food that I payed for with MY money?

I can not fucking stand this shit. This shit really grinds my gears. For example, if I bought some chips and a friend asked for some and I said "No.", I get called an ass or something similar and it pisses me off. It is MINE, I payed for it, not you, ME. Argh. Now before anyone calls me a hypocrite, yes, I do occasionally ask for food, but won't get mad at all if the answer is no.  Its just the uncalled for shit you get called for saying no that gets me mad. Is anyone else on me with this?
