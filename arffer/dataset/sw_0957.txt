I don't know what to do....

I have always aspired to be a high acheever, but as of late my GPA is at an all time low. If anything I know is true, If i dont get into collage, I won't be able to get a job, and I won't be able to provide for my self let alone anyone else. Should I quit while I can make it not hurt?
