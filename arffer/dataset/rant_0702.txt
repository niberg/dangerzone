I'm tired

of the world around me. I'm tired of not being able to speak my mind without it affecting someone. I'm tired of fake friendships. I'm tired of being there for you. I'm tired of speaking my mind while you surf social media. I'm tired of being honest. Because my honesty is intense and brutal. I'm tired of people telling me I lash out when I'm only speaking my opinion. I'm tired of people getting insulted at the shit I say. I'm tired of having to listen to you bitch, but you won't listen to me. I'm tired of you hating on my happiness. I'm tired of telling you my dreams just to be ignored. I'm tired of being me and not fully accepted...I'm tired of all the fake smiles. I'm so tired it makes me sad.
