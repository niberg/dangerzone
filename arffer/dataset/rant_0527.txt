R/jokes...

....oh you copy and pasted a high scoring joke from sickipedia or some other joke site in to Reddit. Aren't you fucking hilarious and interesting? Oh and don't bother crediting the inventor of the joke at all. No no just claim it as your own and feel good about yourself as if you accomplished something or as if you're actually genuinely interesting or funny. You're not. A monkey could do what you do (a smart monkey). You don't deserve to feel good about a copy and paste job and real people will not think you are funny.
