I'm exhausted

I'm not getting good grades at school, people bully me at work, I can't focus, we are going to be losing our home and my father uses me as his emotional dumpster for all of his stress, depression, and anxiety even though I've told him that I can barely handle my own. I'm not a fucking therapist... I don't even feel like a person. My meds help the anxiety, but I just can't take it anymore. I was a self harmer years ago, and its recently coming back full force. I can see the disappointment in my boyfriend's face when he finds my razor blades, or sees the cuts on my legs. My parents told me I was a wasted investment.

I'm tired, I can't stop thinking about how badly I don't want to exist anymore.
