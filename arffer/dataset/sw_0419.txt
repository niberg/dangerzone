Hey guys.

I posted here yesterday for the 1st time. But you know what? I'm done, I really do hate life. Countless therapist, psychologist, it doesn't matter. Medication is worthless, been devoid of happiness for maybe 2 years. But it's just time to go. Reddit was amazing, certain things in life were awesome. But things have gotten so shitty, I'm bored. I have no more paths to take but 1. Both you and I know what it is, see you guys. Or maybe not, who knows. Peace.
