How long does it take to starve yourself to death?

I'm stuck in a really dark place, marriage ending, 20 yr career over and reduced to contract and mall jobs, wife fucked someone else on the day she left, moved to my wife's hometown and have no friends here. I told her to stay away from the house for 2 weeks and come back with a hazmat team. I haven't eaten for 2 days and don't think I want to eat anymore. Haven't had water for the same amount of time. Common sense says no one is worth this, but life constantly in  the dark hole with voices telling you "do it!" and "she's fucking him right now!" and "you're pathetic!" and things that seem to be biting me, and demons appearing who look like my wife, and visions that she's a demon sent here to kill my ability to love. I know I've gone over the edge, all I want is out, I want my wife back, but realistically that's not happening, but before she turned, she was the most wonderful person in the world. But she turned with no advanced warning and I'm here alone in our bedroom and it's night time and soon the demons will be back. I can't do another night like this, but I can't do anything immediate, either. So, I don't want to eat. I'm chubby, I'll probably last a month or so, but every night I want to die and it doesn't stop. Time isn't healing like it's supposed to.
