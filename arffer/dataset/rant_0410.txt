I work with my friend's boyfriend,

I want to rip his face off. Like I get his girlfriends grandparents own the restaurant and he's dating her so he doesn't have to work as hard as some of us do but seriously what the hell! He barely works at all. Both of them are lazy as hell. He went out to 'smoke a cigarette' 10 minutes later I got off work, was leaving and he had gone and picked up a friend and now him and his friend are standing outside doing nothing, I was off work at that point so whatever, I went into the grocery store right across the street spent about 15 minutes in there, come back out and they are still standing outside doing nothing! 

It wouldn't be as bad if he worked hard and then did shit like that but in the 4 hours I worked with him, he went out for multiple cigarette breaks, went and got high, sat at the counter at front and talked to the servers while I kept the dishes done, did tickets, prepped and cleaned. When another one of the cooks leave next month they are going to put me on nights working with this guy all the time!
He is going to be the reason I quit.
