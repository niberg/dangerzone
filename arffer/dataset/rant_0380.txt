Stop asking me to do your work!

I'm sick of answering the questions FOR YOU whenever you do an assignment. 
How the hell are you gonna be a nurse if you can't do anything on your own????
And on another note - you NEVER take out the garbage! EVER! Are you afraid of touching it? Wtf. 
And stop complaining about getting a B in writing. The professor doesn't think your writing's perfect. Get over it.

Done. Needed that.
