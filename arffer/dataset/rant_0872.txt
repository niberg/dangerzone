We fucking get it, okay?

I get it. I "don't look like a boy". My voice isn't low. 

I get it. Stop fucking pointing it out.

Transgender people are very fucking well aware that their bodies are different from what they feel. That's why they have dysphoria.

And that dysphoria mixed with the general ignorance and transphobia is why there is a fucking 41% suicide rate.

I'm so sick of people asking me if I am a boy or a girl. I'm sick of this chest. I'm sick of my genitals. I hate this body, more than *you* (not general you but this one guy who *keeps fucking asking* no matter what I tell him) can even understand. 

We get it, okay? Our bodies aren't what we, and others, expected. 

Goddammit, stop pointing it out, asking about genitals, stop saying that we don't "look like it", stop it. Just fucking stop. 

If you're my friend, then maybe you can ask how the transition is. Maybe we can discuss, **privately** what's happening and how I feel.

That's it. *Only* if we're **friends**.

I hate school.

Holy fuck, I can't wait to transition and move out of here.
