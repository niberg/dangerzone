Why can't I open my goddamn window

So in my dorm, the windows have bolts on them so they can't open more than like 4 inches. So at most you can get a tiny bit of fresh air and that's it. And it's bullshit. The thermostat is really screwy and it gets hot sometimes, and I can't get enough cool air with only 4 inches. And what if there were a fire and I couldn't get out through my door for some reason? Am I supposed to smash the window with a textbook, punch out the screen, and try to jump through the frame with all the shards of glass in the way? I get that they're trying to keep people from like jumping out the window or whatever, but it's stupid. Let me open my goddamn window.
