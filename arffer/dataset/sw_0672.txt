God... I'm close to killing myself

From an outsiders point of view I have  a good life. Job, GF, friends, family and college. Apart from that I can't stand any of it. First my job I fucking hate... I work in retail and it's the same shit over and over... I hate my boss for one, I came out to her with my problems and she said "leave it at the door" fucking great advice. Next, my GF, who is very suicidal, it's a constant sturrgle wirh trying to look after her everyday. Especially considering she doesn't tell me what's wrong most of the time. And hwr family isn't there to help either. she is constantly sad ans won't take she pills she has been given by a doc. She also doesn't want to go to a therapist to talk about it... every night she tells me nasty stuff which I try and help but she won't have any of it. If one day she takes her life. I would too. I love her too much to live without her. My friends I would aay I'm blessed but I could probably give then up. Same with family. College I have lost all motivation for. They fucked up grades over so I stopped going in (I had to switch to an easier course) ans it's too fucking easy.. I could do that shit in my sleep I hate it. Oh yeah. And ny illness 60% chance of heart disease.  50% chance of cancer. And I have a muscular problem in my chest. So its physical and emotional pain I have to deal with... I want to end it all... someone... help.
