This has to stop.

I've finally had enough. I can't handle everyone's bullshit anymore. Everything used to be so simple, and now my entire world has gone to shit. And it's all because I'm a piece of shit. I'm a diagnosed pathological liar, I have severe anxiety, and clinical depression. I'm tired of my family, my "friends", my wife, everybody. This has to end. I can't do this anymore.
