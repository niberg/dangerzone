Checking out of life.

I created an account specifically to post here. I feel as though I've already checked out of life. As though the body that I'm in is continuing to survive only because it has to. I just feel like I've already accepted that I desperately want to die, I've already accepted that killing myself is inevitable. I've checked out almost completely, and I don't see any real point in not going all the way. It feels really lost and lonely. Why shouldn't I check out completely?
