I want to kill myself comment if you want

I have a history of deleting my tumblr accounts. I find people who have mutual interests then I send them my suicidal shit and get anxiety. This one person I have sent some bad messages and she told me to come here one time and told me to call suicide hotlines to get help. My mom got me a phone, which I do not want because talking to people gives me so much anxiety. I have no friends, only family members. I could call for help, but I hate talking on the phone. I feel so bad telling people stuff they don't want to think about. I hurt the people around me and everyone I talk to. Communication always seems to end badly. I have no idea how to help myself. If I had a gun or some rope I would be dead already. I am too scared to cut my throat and there is no way I am poisoning myself.

No one can help me it seems. I have anxiety so bad and I really want to die. I told my sister that communication is death and she told me that isolation is death. I told her that was true and that that means I am defective. She has never helped me. She tells me that I need to stop thinking so negatively all the time, which helps with nothing. My father told me to just feel happy as well. I was diagnosed as an aspie so I am socially retarded anyway. I want to die. I hate talking to people, which means I really cannot survive and feel okay at all. I am lonely and physically tired all the time. I don't sleep enough and I barely go outside. So I am not thinking as well as I used to. I am getting weaker and weaker and I don't want to drag out this out. I want to shoot myself. I don't think this will help, but I am dead so whatever.
