So this just happened...(sick coworkers AGAIN)

I come into work this morning and sit and my computer and my coworker calls me over to her desk. I stand there...she immediately starts coughing in my general direction.

Me: "Are you sick? I'm getting MARRIED this weekend. I can't get sick."

Her: "No, no, it's allergies."

Me: "Okay then..."

10 minutes later she sends out an email: "I think I'm sick! Going home early!"

...now I'm sitting here 4 days away from my wedding starting to feel a tingle in the back of my throat, wondering if I'm now sick too.

FUCK! What the fuck does it take to keep you people home from work?! If you wake the FUCK UP in the morning and think "Hmm, I feel like I have a cold..." don't fucking COME INTO THE FUCKING OFFICE! Work from home!! IT'S 2014! WE HAVE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMMUNICATION rather than face to face contact.

Fuck me, if ebola reaches my state I'm going to be dead because of my goddamn inconsiderate coworkers.
