What the fuck is wrong with colleges forcing you to take a core curriculum?

Why the fuck are we required to take a core curriculum in college? It's wasting literally THOUSANDS of my hard earned dollars. If a class has absolutely nothing to do with my major I should not have to take it. Everything in my History class has been review from high school. I'm fucking terrible at French, I hate it, and might lose a goddamn scholarship because of it. Why should I be forced to waste my time, money, and effort on something I do not care about and has no practical application in my life? How is it okay for them to pretty much steal from me? The whole fucking system is just a huge fucking scam but there's nothing I can fucking do about it if I want any goddamn hope of succeeding in life.
