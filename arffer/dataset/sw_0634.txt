Need help.

Someone posted a comment on a post I made earlier saying "I'm a little tired. I might kill myself". From what I posted, and the comments between myself and others, I felt a bit like that person may have been mocking me. I'm not 100% sure why I thought that, but in my depressed, very sleepy state, I did. So, I said "Are you trying to be funny? Because, that's not at all what I said. If you're serious, don't do that." 

That person then delete their profile. I now feel horrible, and keep thinking "What if that person killed themselves, because of what I said?" I don't really know what to do, but this is awful to me. They could be perfectly fine, which I hope is the case. But, I really don't know.
