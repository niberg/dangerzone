Alcoholics who claim they're disabled.

My mother in laws brother won't help or do anything with his life (whilst she takes care of her mom and dad after fighting cancer) 

You're not disabled, you're a fucking addict. 

Edit- clarifying. 

So one day me and mother in law were splitting wood and needed some help. So I had asked him for help and he looked at me like I was the biggest dick on earth and claims "I'm disabled." so I felt terrible until later on I found out he's an alcoholic.
