i want it to be done.

i don't know why i'm posting really. putting my thoughts out into the world helps me stop then from becoming actions i guess. no one can help me because i can't help myself. i'm tired of being a disappointment and a burden. i want to die so badly but suicide just makes me a shittier person and i'm sick of everything. i've stopped telling anyone how i feel because a) it's exhausting for all involved and b) makes it easier for me to kill myself if i don't go around talking about it, freaking people out. i don't even know anymore. i'm too lazy to try to i feel like i really should just do it haha.

tl;dr: i'm a lazy piece of shit who doesn't change and i want/deserve to die

seriously gonna go sit in the bathroom and debate hanging myself. just want this to be over.
