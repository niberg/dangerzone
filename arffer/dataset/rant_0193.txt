I found something which made me appreciate being stoic--so many are either DUMB/RETARDED or CONSPIRING PREDATORS!

This epigrammatic ballad--'3 FLIES ON THE SAME TURD'  http://youtu.be/bASiYzsPWTE sums it up. Who are the "flies" and who are the "turds"? And the last line--"if you struggle you're absurd...etc", attached to a riddle. Think about it. 

PS: I sorta resent myself too for being too dumb, too many times. Sucked in by the tricks and none making me the wiser. No point thinking we can NEVER be 'controlled'--the appearances are just too slick.
