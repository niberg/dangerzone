The Birthday Massacre

I hate it when I'm on Facebook, trying to say Happy Birthday to someone, and the band "Birthday Massacre," comes up trying to be tagged. It's been a consistent annoyance that comes up whenever I want to celebrate. I mean, it's possible that the band did that on purpose as a way to advertise. But then again, it could just be an annoying coincidence. Either way it's inconvenient and I'm never gonna look up or buy their music.
