Why the fuck are you paid to write?!

I've seen so many fucking news articles that are POORLY WRITTEN. 1: The simple spelling mistakes. Do these people not proofread?! A 5th grade student that hates writing could still be Stephen King compared to them. 2: Redundancy. I've been seeing a bunch of articles that have the same shit over and over. First paragraph: A man was arrested for rape. Second paragraph: The man raped a teenage girl. Third paragraph: The man was arrested for raping a teenage girl. Fourth paragraph: The girl is in therapy. Fifth paragraph: The man who raped the girl was arrested. WE ALREADY KNOW THIS SHIT! WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU REPEATING YOURSELF?! I'm a fucking 18-year-old and I abandoned this behavior YEARS ago. Even then, I only did it when I had to write a certain amount of pages and I was out of ideas. JUST STOP. JUST END THE ARTICLE INSTEAD OF BULLSHITTING AND REPEATING YOURSELF. Goddamnit, man. End rant.

edit: Found a video from another comment section. If those writers did TV scripts, *[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg4z7mzaVco)* is what their shows would look like.
