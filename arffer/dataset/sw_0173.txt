I can't see any reason to go on.

Here it is, a list of all the negatives:

* I am a registered sex offender (When I was 17 I accidentally downloaded 4 indecent images. My laptop, which was just left in my room, unused for 2 years, was looked at by police, when I was 19, for evidence in a bullying case. They found it. I was very shocked. Legal representation was a shambles. Best option was to plead guilty.).

* Five years on the register. Have to tell police where I am if I spend more than 7 nights in 1 year in any place. Regular visits. Cannot be in same place with under 18 year old. 

* 200 hours community service (Not sure what it's like near anyone else, but here, it's mostly sitting around waiting to be told what to do. I "Work" 7 hours a day, but only work for about 1. The rest is sitting. Waiting.

* Â£460 fine. I am a second year university student. This money is being taken straight out of the small amount of money I had which barely covers food.

* Probably will never be allowed into the States, will never get to take my future kids to Disneyland.

* My brilliant friends whom I loved and respected have all abandoned me.

* The one thing keeping me together was my girlfriend. Utterly gorgeous. Funny. Smart. Sexy. Just brilliant company. Would like to spend my life with her. But her father said to her "You and I cannot have a relationship" whilst you are seeing him (Me). She tries seeing me in secret. I say seeing me, we live together. But eventually the whole thing kills her attraction for me. She leaves me, then 4 days later, is with someone else. She's at his place now. Sleeping in his bed. Having sex. She was my first. The only person I've ever slept with. The only person I've ever wanted to.

* After A level, I realised how much I wanted to become an A level teacher. I wanted to help people. I wanted to work for a charity called War Child UK. But after an accident. Something I knew nothing about. I get thrown in the same category as rapists. 

* I'm terrified of leaving the house. I get yelled at "Paedo!" in the street a bit.

I'm not a monster. I'm just... Normal. Completely normal. And I've lost everything because of one silly mistake.

I don't see life getting much better. I just want my girlfriend back. She made me happy. Now I have nothing. No friends. No future. No money. No time for my degree. No permission to kiss the woman I love.

Help me. Because I can't take this. I can't do it.
