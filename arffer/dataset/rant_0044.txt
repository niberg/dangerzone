"/s" is retarded

There are two reasons to use /s at the end of a sentence.

A) Because you're trying to hard to be sarcastic.

B) Because you're 14 and just do what everybody else is doing.

if (A == true) {
DoType = false; //do not send message
return;
}

if (B == true) {
Message.Remove(Message.Length - 2); // remove the last two characters from message
Message.Post();
}

/s is the text equivalent of explaining the joke three seconds after it, and then saying "get it guise?  So funny amirite xDDD lel."

If you do this, stop.  Now.  It lets people get away with shitposting (e.g. going on a thread about the Holocaust and saying "Hitler was so cool /s". Nobody cares.  Leave.

Proper sarcasm should not need to be explained.  Proper sarcasm is funny.  If you are going to put /s after your sentence DO NOT SAY ANYTHING.  It's like telling a mean fat joke, and then saying "no offense" directly at the fat guy in your group.

Jesus fucking Christ.
