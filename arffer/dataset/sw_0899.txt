I've pushed everyone away.

Somehow, through my own stupidity and lack of awareness, I've managed to push everyone who cared about me away from me. No one even seems to notice me and all I want to do is disappear for good so they can get on with their lives. No amount of introspection has helped me. I am so furious that I could smash a fucking car. I'm in therapy but I don't even know what I'm looking for. Seems it's bipolar. I don't even want to talk but I can't say no. 

It's like I want to punch someone for dragging a conversation on unless I can see the point in it. Everyone seems to be acting so high and mighty and I can't see the point in it. Everything just feels pointless and I want to fucking end it. 

My mother, if I tell her this kind of stuff that I carry, just asks questions in response. I hate her for it so much. I can't compose something more rational or fluent right now.
