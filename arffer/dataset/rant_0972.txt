She Irks Me

Just a small rant. My boyfriend's ex girlfriend is going to be at a concert a few hours away that I'm not going to and even though she has a boyfriend and he tells me he doesn't still have feelings for her, it just irks me that she'll be there. He says he's not going to see her while he's there, and I believe him. Even if he did, nothing would happen. I just hate it. 

The concert is really really important to him so I'm keeping quiet since I'm being irrational but I just want Monday to come and go. Ugh.
