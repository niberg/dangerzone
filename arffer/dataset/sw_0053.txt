I'm not going

But I can't stay here or they'll send the cops after me.

I'm not going **I'M NOT GOING**

They know I can't afford it but they won't cancel so now they'll bill me more and have me arrested and locked up in the ~~psychiatric institution~~ **RAPE AND TORTURE DUNGEON THAT CHARGES $100,000 TO RAPE AND TORTURE YOU**

Couldn't do it yesterday, too much of a fucking coward

Have to do it today

Won't

Too much of a coward

Just lying here on the flooor

Cold

Hungry

Too scared to be angry too angry to be scared too sad to be anything

Whiny fucking bitch thats what i am
