I got fired on my third day at work. I'm bitter, angry and sad.

I got a job at a small toy store with only two other staff at the time. I was so happy to work at a small and wonderful little store. I started training on Monday. I'm a bit clumsy and airheaded but I really wanted to try my best, and I did. I thought the training would last at least a week, like normal. I learned how to greet customers, ring people up, and while I wasn't very good at first, I slowly began to get better. I wanted my boss to see that I was getting better, but she didn't. Today she told me she was letting me go because they really wanted someone "who was a part of the team." I thought I was. I thought she could see I was getting better. IT WAS ONLY MY THIRD DAY THERE. I'm so bitter and sad that they let me go on my third day because I couldn't adapt quick enough. I'm trying really hard not to let this completely crush my self-confidence. This isn't fair, and I'm angry.
