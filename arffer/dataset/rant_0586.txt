Why can't anyone just fucking enjoy something?!

Seriously, every fucking thing gets so deeply dug into on the internet! It's annoying as hell. Do you like videogames, maybe with a controller and local mp and without a bunch of hassle? LOL, PEASANT, GET A 350B PROCESSOR OR GTFO!! Or maybe you like Bayonetta, or Lollipop Chainsaw. Hell, maybe you enjoy looking at the female form in general. Congrats, you're a sexist mysogonist that gives women unfair standards! 

Do you enjoy showing off your body, regardless of size or color? Maybe you're comfortable in your current state, a little chubby or broken out? Get ready to face hordes of "fat-logic" twats online. Or dear god let's hope you don't like fedoras, or fingerless gloves, or Nickleback, or talking a bit old-timey, or trench coats; for these make you a "neckbeard" a BS term the oh so great and amazing and sexy fuckers of the internet invented. Also believing you actually have bad luck with women despite trying your best? Wow you must be such a fuckin' asshole.

Fuck this hateful fucking circlejerk of a website.
