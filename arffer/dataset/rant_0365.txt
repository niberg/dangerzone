My professor refuses to accept that Edison was a poor inventor and an even worse person.

So on Wednesday, he claims that Edison was the best inventor of the 19th century. Me, being a fairly large Tesla fanboy, corrects him on his error. Not saying that Tesla was the best, but I am saying that Edison was definitely not. 

Anyway, on test day, one of the questions was "who was the best inventor of the 19th century?" The only viable answer being Edison. 

The professor happened to walk past my desk while I was writing, in very large letters, "&lt;--NOOOOO." He laughed, saying that he expected me to take some action on that question.

I'm not furious, but I WAS FORCED TO WRITE THAT EDISON WAS THE BEST INVENTOR OF THE 19TH CENTURY AND I AM SO UPSET.
