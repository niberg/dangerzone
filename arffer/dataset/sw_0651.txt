I've been slowly killing myself over the past few years. I've alienated myself from my family and friends, can't hold down a job, and have finally run out of motivation and lifelines. I'm only posting this because the internet has been my one true friend over the years. 
 

To those of you who try to help people like me, thank you, I hope you guys live prosperous and fulfilling lives. To those of you who are in a similar situation, I hope you can stay strong. Goodbye, I'm adhering to my own timeline now.
