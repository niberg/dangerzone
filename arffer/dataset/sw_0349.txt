I only see two options

16 years old, male. I live with a parent who says they love me, but also constantly talks about how they can't wait until I'm gone, and they'll finally be free. But he won't let me leave before I'm 18. It sucks to hear how terrible I am, how arrogant, self-centered and worthless I am, and it really sucks when I ask how I can not be these things and he just says I "just don't get it" and tells me to leave him alone. I hate being told all this, and because he can't tell me why I'm so arrogant or self-centered there's nothing I can do to change it. I can't talk about anything important because if I disagree with him he gets really upset, no matter what I'm disagreeing with him about. He will literally storm off for several days because I don't understand what's wrong with gay marriage from a non-religious point of view.

I can't live like this. I want to leave, but I'm a minor in the US so he can just call the police and have me arrested if I do. I can't pretend to be someone else, or pretend to be an adult without breaking some laws with severe punishments. Thee only option other than leaving is to just die, and while that seems hard it looks better and better each day.

Does anyone know a state or a country I can get to easily where I can just live on my own for a few years without getting arrested? I'd live with family, but he won't let me because he says that "no one would want to live with you", and in the US I can't live with family unless he says so.

Youth emancipation isn't an option either, he won't let me get a job, and even if I had one the cheapest leases around here are several thousand dollars a month, and in my state Minors can work only 18 hours a week, even if they have already graduated (I have).
