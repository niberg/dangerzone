"...and I lost it." "Did you find it?"

FUCK people who make this comment. Do they actually believe that by copy and pasting the same retarded joke (which wasn't funny to begin with) they're somehow original and hilarious? Fuck no. It's unoriginal bullshit that isn't funny, the best thing it could be called is a desperate grab for karma. AND IT ALWAYS FUCKING WORKS AND IS A HIGHLY UPVOTED COMMENT. Seriously, I've seen it like fucking ten times today, it's bullshit, it's unfunny, it's cringeworthy, and it's fucking retarded.
