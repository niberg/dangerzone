i'm trying really hard but i don't think i will make itI

hi i'm not sure exactly why im posting here but i feel like i should be doing something, anything so, yeah.. 

i just turned 18. i've been suffering for about 6 years from body dysmorphic disorder and anorexia before that. it has gotten to the point where i'm certain i am in the wrong body. like if i could i would scoop my brains out and put them in a different body and sometimes i wish really hard that i could somehow. my personal identity and my body and appearance are so detached that every time i look in the mirror i'm shocked at what looks back at me (thats why i started avoiding mirrors but reflective surfaces are everywhere). i took a couple of years of treatment but it honestly didnt help. i don't think there is anything anyone can even do for me anymore.

i don't want to die. like i really don't. i cry when i think about all the things i am going to miss. i'm never gonna have a girlfriend, i'm never gonna get my diploma, never going to go to uni... i wish i could do all those things. i wish i could live but i cant like this and it's freaking me out. like how the hell are you supposed to help someone in my situation? 

last time i told them i wanted to kill myself was in the summer, and it was horrible. they stuck me in a room, told my mum (in front of me, whoopdy fucking do that was fun) and got some doctor id never met before to ask me a bunch of random questions. so you better believe im not makinig that mistake again.

not sure what im doing posting here but it feels a little better to write things down.
