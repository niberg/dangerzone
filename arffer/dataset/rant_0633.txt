I've read too many articles about how low oil prices are bad...WTF???

WTF is wrong with people??? I've read the 3rd article today saying how low oil prices are doom for us, in this case it was the airline industry...Seriously this need to fucking stop. The people writing these articles are so embedded with Wall Street analysts saying how this will drive the price down of stocks that they are creating a false panic...

How about an article saying that yesterday was the 1st time in maybe 2-3 years that I saw a gas station with unleaded gas under $3.00, or how you should be investing in shipping and trucking companies because their profits will actually GO UP because prices on fuel have dropped significantly or how increases in fuel economy in modern cars combined with North Dakota and Canadian oil drilling has made us not Import oil from Nigeria and OPEC country for the 1st time in like 20+ years....
