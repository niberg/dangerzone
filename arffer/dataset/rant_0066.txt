I told someone to "fuck off" and "go to hell" today. I felt good about it!

Beginning yesterday, I came to a conclusion that I had developed a bad habit of being too polite and accommodating of other people. I enjoy the role of peace-maker but realize that my true feelings have been getting buried in that process. I consider myself a fair person with good intentions but I'm also the kind of person who likes to let people know exactly where I stand I don't take kindly to bullshit.

Upon concluding that I've been being a bit of a wimp for the better part of this year and having attributed this to recent depression and lethargy, I decided I needed to start being more frank with people. Waking up today, I sort of forgot about this revelation and moped around my apartment. However, I attempted to reason with someone who I've recently had personal differences with. As soon as they got smart with me, I told them I wouldn't bother arguing with them. They decided to keep going at it so I let them know how I really felt and told them to "fuck off" and to "go to hell." Having not said anything like that in recent memory, I was a bit confused afterwards. Quickly however, I started to feel a bit of pride for sticking up for myself instead of trying to patch up the situation.

Fast forward a few hours later, my overly-nice ways started to get the best of me and I contemplated an apology. Again though, I was able to reject that sentiment and decided that I did the right thing. I started to feel a release of anger coming from my body. I spent a minute using a makeshift punching bag and enjoyed the rush.

I may butt heads along the way, but my new found feelings of being ultra-frank might just be the cure I need for my depression. I have made some mistakes this year and have at times been selfish. Nonetheless, a lot of other people have treated me poorly and I don't deserve any of their crap. Tonight, I declare: FUCKEM!!!!
