What do I do

I have no drive to do any kind of schoolwork and it's eating away at my livelihood. I have some kind of undiagnosed mental condition that drives me to fail, and i can't control it. I have an essay to write that was due monday and I am 2 weeks behind in all my other hm, and I know it sounds lame as fuck but I can't make myself do it. I don't have a problem with social situations or the like, but everything in my life is crumbling in front of me and I can't take it anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't know how to end the pain I cause to myself and others. I think I can't do it anymore.
If there is another sub for crazy people, i could go there too. but I don't understand how to cope with being mentally retarded.
