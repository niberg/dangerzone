What a cocknocker.

So, I play on a team. My team played a different team, and their coach was an ass. He cussed out his players and alienated the players families, he banned a kid from playing a game or two because he talked back to the coach. He'd been making calls from the sideline - not allowed - and being an all around douchebag in a sport where the players have nothing but love for each other. 

I'd forgotten how good getting heated felt. I'd forgotten the rush I get from squaring my shoulders and throwing my two cents real fast at somebodys face. I crossed his path walking to the other side of the field and made sure I didn't move when I realized we would make contact. We brushed shoulders, and where I come from that's a good enough reason to turn around and ask a man if he's in his right mind. He promptly did that, to which I responded "One more time.", implying that it was his fault and there would be repercussions for a second infraction. 

I get brawly. I genuinely wish that I'd gotten in a fight with that dumb drunk son of a bitch.
