My previous GM thinks all the employees are losers for working there.

I recently quit my barista job because it was managed so poorly. The place is so chaotic and I like to take pride in what I do but this place left me with little pride while attempting to give great customer service with the resources I had available. Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful cafe that I would always go to before I got hired there but man, was I in for a shock. The general manager recently had her own pastry/coffee/restaurant/bar shut down...gee I wonder why?! Maybe because she couldn't stick to one thing at her previous place. Well she has managed to do the same at this place...it serves coffee, tea, smoothies, protein shakes, pastries, beer, wine, mixed drinks, sandwiches, breakfast, brunch....it sound good in theory...hey you never gotta leave the cafe you enjoy studying at right, wrong. The workers, including myself, were/are not trained properly to do all of these things and are often left to work alone and attend to the rush of people that come in. Anyways, so that's a little back story. The General Manager told the Assistant Manager that all the baristas that work there are LOSERS for even working there. So please tell me how a General Manager is suppose to run a business efficiently when she doesn't even respect what her employees do. Mind you, the majority of the employees are in college or recent graduates and are doing this in the meantime (including myself). I have my spouse that can support us so I decided to leave the place because of the way it was managed and b/c the GM spoked to us in a super condescending tone....(that's another rant though).
