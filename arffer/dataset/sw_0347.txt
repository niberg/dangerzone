I need to help him

last night i got a phone call from my best friend who i have known since 3rd grade. He has been my rock and my reason i'm still going strong. Well anyway last night he called me crying and screaming about how his life is ruined and everybody hates him. we talked for 2 hours, then he told me he was planning on attempting suicide again for the 3rd time this week. i began crying because he is the strongest most level headed person i know. i talked to him some more and he calmed down. after he said he was ok, i called his mom and told her everything he told me. she did not care at all. she said and i quote "if he is that stupid than let him do it." i talked him into seeing a movie with me today but i need to know what my next move needs to be. because with out him, i may be posting on this sub for myself.
