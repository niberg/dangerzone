Lost my job today, No Job = No money = no house = No life. (goodbye)

Growing up under bad circumstances i have a dark side.
My dark side is to see things the negative way, say bad things, and be a jackass.  Got my self to blame since my work colleges teamed up on me and got me fired.

When you get fired, in my country that means you will get no "unemployed" money when you are in the meantime looking for a new job.

No other job will hire you since you are a bad influence.
And you will pretty much have a hard time getting a new job or money to do your normal living.

I'm tired of this, all of it.

As we speak i have swallowed 20 Tramadol pills.
as stated on box you should not take more than one for strong pains.

Goodbye everyone on reddit, at least you guys where nice to me. 
Thank you for reading. I will read reply's as long as i can hold out, there is no saying how fast these pills will take me down.
