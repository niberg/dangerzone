Just wanted to say to those who reached out that I'm alive.

I just got out of the psych ward, did some jailtime too. I was going to shoot myself in the head but a friend found out, called my parents who called the police and said I had a gun and was going to shoot myself. Suddenly there was SWAT, bomb squad, 3 police departments and about 60 officers surrounding my house. Me being smart, slipped away before they got set up. There was 6 negotiators and I ran from just after 4pm till exactly 10am the next day. Chased through the woods by dogs, had my vehicles tracked down and impounded. Laid in the rain for hours and ended it all with a nice cup of coffee before the final standoff. I was put in jail under suicide watch until my Attorney arranged for me to be transfered to the psych center. I just got released earlier and wanted to just say hello and assure you few that I am okay. I'm being properly medicated and I'm doing pretty well. Realy scared for my court case though. Have pending felonies from all of this. I'd put up the news article but it would identify me. Can easily be googled though.
