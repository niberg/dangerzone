Seriously reddit what the fuck?

Let me start off by saying I know not all of reddit is like this, nor is it limited to reddit, it's just easier this way.

I'm just so sick of reddit's shit sometimes. Some people are just either so full malice, completely insensitive, petty, and WAY too fucking eager to be 'right'.

And then today I saw another comment of someone accusing the poster of using their family member's death for karma. SERIOUSLY?

On the off-chance that you are in fact right about someone using death for karma, is it REALLY worth calling them out on bullshit if there's any chance it's real? If it's real you could seriously hurt someone who is just looking for solace.

It's a trend I notice. People are so eager to call bullshit on everything. I cringe every time someone links to /r/thathappened or /r/HailCorporate. I'm sure they're right sometimes. Who cares? This site had [174 million unique visitors](http://www.reddit.com/about/) just last month. Last I knew, and this was years ago, there were at least 30 million registered users. 30 million+ is a LOT of people. It'd be weird if between all of them, nothing strange/crazy ever happened. 

I'm not naive about people lying, but I'll suspend my disbelief if the only harm that comes out of it is people getting some internet points.
