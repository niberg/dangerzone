The 3 people who are suppose to love me the most...

Sunday my dad tried to kill himself. Failed.
Monday he tries to kill himself. Failed, but os now hospitalised.
Tuesday night I overhear my mum speaking about killing herself. I don't know what happened in the end but she's still here.
Thursday my girlfriend tries to kill herself, then again on friday, then again on saturday, and today she took whatever she could find and is now in hospital.
Why can't I try?
