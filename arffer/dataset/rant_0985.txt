Rant about how I just want to start drinking heavily

This capstone class is seriously stressing me out so bad, my anxiety is coming back and I can't sleep anymore and I'm starting to have horrible dreams. This professor is so unorganized. She posted our midterm grades and said they were out of a possible 580 points but my grade book says I only have a possible 470 points so now I'm even more freaked out. If I don't pass this class I can't graduate and between taking a break to deal with pregnancy and severe depression this 4 year degree is taking me 7 years and I just want to drop out and quit trying and start drinking and ugh ugh ugh ugh.
