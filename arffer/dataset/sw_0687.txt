I think about suicide, probably 2-3 times a week...

but reading peoples stories on here has helped me realize its more a knee jerk reaction to stress and depression in my life. mostly from the fact that comparatively my life is pretty good. 

I have people who love me, a fiancée, a decent job, and some family. the biggest thing that drives my suicidal thoughts are that ive amounted to nothing in my life and don't have much of a future. And while I do have family that care about me, ive always felt like a stranger and an outsider to them. im always told I look so sad in my photos and was able to fake a really good smile for a picture during my birthday dinner on sunday night. fiancée was so surprised by the smile and happy to get it in photograph.

but im honest with her. she knows I have these thoughts pretty often, and that one side of my family has history of mental illness. my sister attempted suicide 3 times.

not sure where im really going with this post. it just helps to talk about it sometimes. im afraid enough of death that I don't think I could go though with it. but recently ive been becoming more at peace with dying as a whole,  which makes me worry ill lose my biggest defense against suicide some day.
