Am I turning suicidal?

Ok..I have been struggling with depression for some time. I haven't told this to my family cuz they already have a lot to deal with and need me to be their support. They love me and I love them. But lately I've been feeling exhausted of everything. I want to end it all..but I don't want it to be a suicide. It'll hurt the people I love. I keep praying, hoping for an accident. I've started hoping I'll die when I'm driving or maybe get a serious electric shock or something. I'm scared it might get to a point where I start contemplating ways to kill myself. I don't know what I'm expecting by posting this here, but I feel things are getting a little out of hand..help?
