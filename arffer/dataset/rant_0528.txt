My boss is about to force to to commit an act of bio terrorism.

I have chronic migraine disorder. My Imatrex is at home about 20 min away from my work. I asked my boss to allow me to take a long lunch to go home and get it. Shouldn't be a problem, I don't have any more tasks for the day and I have comp time. Leaving for a few hours on a Friday? Shouldn't be a big deal. 


But my boss is a grown-up mean girl so of course it is. 


She won't let me leave *just cos*. I've been here 3 months and never asked for a day off, to leave early, a long lunch etc. she just said, "Ladyfries, you can't just *use* comp time." Yes I can? That's what it's there for? You let other people leave for shit all the time and they can use their comp time, no questions asked? Wtf.


So I decided that when I enviaitably vomit in two hours, I'm going to puke in the trash can in my office and set it outside my door in the hallway.
