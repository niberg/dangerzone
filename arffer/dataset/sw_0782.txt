I want to die but I don't know why

For a year now I've felt like I want to die but I feel like a fucking asshole because I don't have a bad life; I have normal parents, a few close friends, a job I enjoy. When I'm by myself I'll think 'What's the point of my life' but I can't think of anything to answer it and I'll have those 'what if you just killed yourself' thoughts.  I've always been a quiet person with mild social anxiety, I don't really find joy in normal social activities and I find it hard to talk to new people.  

Recently I've found myself being colder towards my family and not meeting friends as much, and I'll just sit at home by myself thinking about how I would do it but to much of a fucking pussy to go through with it so I'll cut myself instead and the thoughts will go away for a little while.

I've tried to hide my emotions from my friends and family and they don't seem to notice, but I don't feel like I can talk to any of them about how I feel because I know they think suicide is selfish and I don't want to be branded as an attention seeker or something.

What the fuck is wrong with me.
