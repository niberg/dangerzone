I feel like I'm getting closer. I'm scared. nothing works. I'm tired. I don't want to feel scared anymore.

I'm scared of being alone, I'm scared of not being loved, I'm scared of failing at paying my rent, paying for school, failing my grades. Sticking around for the people that care about me doesn't seem worth it anymore.

My girlfriend broke up with me last week. She always said we would be together for years but we didn't even last a few months. She said she loves me and wants to be friends for ever but how can I trust that she won't break that promise either? 

My father has had the same relationship problems, the same drug problems, the same emotional problems as me for over 20 years, he is alone, an alcoholic, no one can depend on him. I've slowly moved towards being like him in different ways without even noticing it until its too late. 

I can't handle these bad feelings, these rejections, ineffective therapies, girls who love me and then reject me, empty sex, constant fear of abandonment, being alive is not free. 

I feel like I'm getting closer to being able to kill myself.

The other night, she stood me up and I hate myself for responding the way i did but i practiced hanging myself with my belt in a doorway. It works really well and i think i might do it that way.

I went home to my shitty apartment tonight and tried it out again, i went farther and almost passed out and had strange mental hallucinations(not schizo), I almost accidentally hung myself just now. I don't know what to do, life is too long to live like this and nothing works, nothing every stays good and i can't handle it.

I've tried to get treatment, it never worked. now I'm too poor to get help and my parents don't support me anymore. don't i deserve to die so that i don't have to suffer anymore?
