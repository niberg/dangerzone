Buying gifts for my 17 year old sucks.

It was easy when she was little.  But now I can buy exactly what she picks out and she never ever wears it.  She wanted a Marilyn Monroe tshirt, I got her an adorable Marilyn shirt that she has not worn in the 4 months since I bought it.  She wanted some high top tennis shoes that weren't wedges so I let her pick them out and ordered them.   Had them in time for her birthday in August and she has never wore them.  And she can't be trusted with giving her cash.  She's about to start getting nothing for her birthdays :( Or bought for her just for the hell of it.
