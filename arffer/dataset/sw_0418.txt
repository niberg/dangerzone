I feel awful

My girlfriend won't talk to me at all. She turned off all forms of communication with me an hour ago and the last thing she said is "I'm preparing." She's been having suicidal thoughts, and I don't feel good. I slept in. I could have stopped it, but I FUCKING SLEPT IN. I feel absolutely awful. I fucking hate myself. I love her more than anything and I miss her fucking so much. I want her to be okay.
