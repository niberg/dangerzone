For the love of god learn how to touch type. Starting keystrokes from 2 inches in the air is going to defeat the purpose of a quiet keyboard.

I'm at work right now, listening to a guy type (hammer) on a dell quiet key keyboard from 10 feet away. His fingertips start from 2 inches above the keyboard and just peck **peck PECK**. No sane amount of padding is going to mask his hammering. I would probably have to change the keyboard out for a laptop style keyboard AND put cotton padding on the underside of it to muffle him properly.
