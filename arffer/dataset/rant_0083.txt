Sensationalist headlines

Your jaw did not hit the goddamn floor. Ok, some guy did something nice for his girlfriend. Some people said some sexist things. A good singer didn't look like a good singer is supposed to look. These are not amazing stories. I *will* believe what happened next. These are all perfectly normal things to fucking happen. Stop posting them on gooddamn Facebook because I don't care how this article will make me see something totally differently (which, by the way, it won't. Shockingly, I, unlike apparently 99% of the rest of the population according to your stupid headline, am already not a raging homophobe, sexist, or racist who thinks homeless kids can't sing). Fuck your headlines and all the goddamn people in Facebook friends with who post them that I would unfriend except there are so many of them I can't keep up. 

And fuck Gives Me Hope for apparently selling their page or something so instead of inspiring stories they're now posting this garbage.

God, that felt good. I couldn't exactly put it on my Facebook though. 

Addition: Oh my god, the Harry Potter cast grew and changed physically over ten years and going through puberty? Who the hell could have predicted that?
