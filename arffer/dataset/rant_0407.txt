Simplistic boring, dull contemporary design is annoying the shit out of me

Once upon a time, we had intricate logos. We had intricate, well drawn, thought out logos. Logos that had a unique identity. In the past few years, we've seen brands have inexplicably ditched their logos and gone for these pathetic square, simple, boring designs probably just to copy Apple. Look at Microsoft, for fuck sake. They made an entire OS out of the principle "SIMPLE SQUARE STUFF IS BETTR GUIZ". Microsoft also just released the new version of Skype. Skype on Desktop was a good, productive product. Now it looks like the shitty Windows 8 version, the fucking cunts. I've gone off topic, but boy was typing this rant out fun.
