So fed-up with our politicians and the way elections are handled.

I'm so tired of all this bullshit with the elections. All the ads are negative and slamming each other, and all the media outlets want to talk about are the polls. I'm so tired of the "vote the bums out" mantra. What is the point of replacing old bums with new bums, nothing changes, its all just "Us vs. Them" and grown adults arguing like children over semantics and nothing gets done.  I feel like the only reason I vote anymore is so I don't have to hear shit from people who say "if you don't vote, don't complain." I think its worth complaining if ALL of the options just perpetuate the same lies and worthlessness.  Our two-party system is crap, it serves no purpose, there are so many different schools of thought it is not possible to reflect that with two different affiliations.  The Democrats tell us that the country will go to hell if Republicans win the majority, the Republicans say nothing will get done if they don't. Both sides refuse to ever work together for the good of the people. The very fact that all the outgoing politicians took the LAST MONTH OFF OF WORK because some of them are leaving should be proof that they no longer care about how their decisions effect the public. They are essentially admitting they don't care.
I'm just going to vote for the best Independent candidates and hopefully when enough people start doing this our government will actually see that we have very little faith in them anymore, if any at all.
