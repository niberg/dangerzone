23 years old lonely almost have made a choice to die in future

I am 23 years old, male, no close friends, no close relationships, only one distant friend we meet rarely, unemployed, afraid of being forever alone, no purpose, lacking hobbies/interests basically talk to myself all day thinking about the past, present and future. I see that my country has 60 million people, only around 2 million unemployed therefore most are successful and assuming population being 60 million means that most people live normal lives. A normal life is when you have quality relationships (at least some close people in your life/community) employed, girlfriend, saving money for house/car, having children, children growing up and having grand-children and the normal' life cycle continues. problem is I do not have this normal' life. My reasons for life are becoming less and less. It is starting to become logical, rational and wise to commit suicide. Please I need help how can I develop a healthier state of mind? how will I cope? I think i would really miss the world if I choose to die but not feeling like there is any other options.
