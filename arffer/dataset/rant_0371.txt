Man, I hate cell phones.

I really do.

There's no time I'm allowed to be alone. If I don't respond to people's texts within half an hour, I'm either 1. Dead, if you're my family, or 2. The shittiest person alive, because I don't care to hear you whine about your problems.

I spend most of my time working on personal projects. Some things I can be interrupted in, but most, like programming, demand my uninterrupted attention. It's just too easy to fall off a train of thought in solving a problem, and I have to start all over again. But no, if I don't respond to you immediately, I'm selfish. Or worse, I'm "isolating," and I need your help to get out of my deep depression.

I'm not sorry that I don't enjoy distraction as much as you do. Get a damn hobby.
