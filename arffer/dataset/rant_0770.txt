I'm sorry you dunno what it's like to have a kid, but you don't need to bitch to me about the noise level

In Barnes and Nobel they got a decent sized children's section with a lot of fun things to look at and do for kids, it's not my fault that all their toys their all packaged and expensive. My four year old couldn't help herself!!! It's not her fault age don't know what she doing, you want me to pat 30.00 for a fuckin bear????? Just put it back in the fuckin box!!! Then when I take it away and she cries you look at me all fuckin crazy, kids cryit happens, get over it n stop judging me
