Dancing with the idea...

I feel like a complete waste of space, useless, pointless to everyone even the slightest bit involved in my life.   
I see the lies that spout from the mouths of the fakers, those who feign concern for my well being for the slight second before catching a glimpse of themselves in the mirror and being reminded of how fucking important they are.   
I feel myself rotting away day by day, slowly dying and filling the world around me with my putrid odor.    
I want to make it real, I want to breathe my last breaths as I feel the weight of my body become immovable and no longer my own. I want to end this loneliness, this pain.
