TRIGGER WARNING. My mother and my self-harm habit.

I came back home after being away for about three days. 

I guess my mom was looking for me that morning and since I had been so stoned out of my mind the night before I couldn't wake up. As someone who suffers from insomnia, any sleep for me is amazing. So I was out cold and it was probably noon. She was banging on my bedroom door and when I woke up and went out to see her I forgot to put on pants. 

This ends up with her seeing my legs, which are covered with recent marks from a self-harm episode a couple days ago. 

Her reaction was classic, she made it all about herself. 

I couldn't even explain myself so I blamed it on school. She has just been mad at me about it but absolutely has avoided talking about it, which is great. 

For fucks sake why can't I have the final say about my body?

Plus, my self harm isn't going to kill me. I'm very well versed in anatomy and very well aware of how deep I am cutting and where I am cutting. 

Regardless, if I did die from it... who cares? Certainly not me.
