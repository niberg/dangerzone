FUCK YOU REGIONS

I've been banking with regions for 2 and a half years, and I think I'm done. 

Three weeks ago, I did my "bill pay" for my credit card, on the online site, like I have been for the entire time I've been banking with them.  Last week, I went back to check my statement, and the credit card payment was not processed, and the bill pay "recent activity" board said I hadn't made a payment since July.  So I tried it again on Wednesday, and I NEEDED it to go through by Friday, since my bill was due that day.  Well yesterday, I got an email from my CC company saying my bill was past due and I owe a $40 late fee plus paying interest on my balance. WHAT THE FUCK REGIONS.  I know for a fact it went through, I double checked the second time because it was ABSOLUTELY necessary that it went through correctly this time.  I have never had a late payment, and I'm afraid it will ding my credit score for my perfect payment history.  

I tried calling them yesterday, and their automated system put me on hold for 10 minutes and then it hung up on me.  I was pissed, but I called back.  Had to wait 10 minutes to talk to a person, and then a few minutes into our call, she was going to put me on hold, and she freaking hung up on me too.  

I started to call back, but the automated system said it would be a 10+ minute wait.  FUCK THIS.  Fuck all of this.  I'm done with Regions.  I need to know that my bank can be reliable with my credit card payments, these things are important and customer service obviously isn't a priority with these people.
