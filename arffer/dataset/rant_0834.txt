A&amp;P Prof keeps mentioning, "If you believe in evolution..."

Really??  The entire field of biology, including anatomy and physiology, is based on the theory of evolution.  There is no "believing" in evolution, just as there is no "believing" in gravity.  It's either true or it's not, belief has nothing to do with it.  I swear the next-fucking-time he says, "If you believe in evolution..." I'm going to stand up and declare there is no belief in evolution, there is only scientific fact.
