Well crap

This is my first rant so excuse me if I miss something.

      I waited until last minute once again to work on my homework and it does not look good. I generally finish my average homework load in 30 minutes but not if it has accumulated over a while, but in my defense it is the stupid teachers fault. We are supposed to have a full school week to do some literature crap, but because of Veteran's Day we have Monday and Tuesday off so you think she would move the turn in date two days right? WRONG. She says we should be able to do it in any amount of time given!? THE HELL? Almost all the kids in class don't have this book so some of us can't take it home and we shouldn't have to devote our time to your schedule! And on top of that I have a 800 word script due on Wednesday, but my parents force me to do all my work in one sitting.
End rant or whatever I'm supposed to say
