Internet forum based discussions are masochistic endeavors and the effects of them are similar to farting in the wind

People engage in billion topics and issues and debates over forums and whatever social media outlets are out there.

I think that amount of people who entered a discussion with actual desire to learn what's the mindset of others is in low decimal numbers. It's either "I've came here to reiterate my beliefs and I'll try to force them upon you, passively or aggressively" or it's "la la la I'm not listening (reading) you, I'm here to smell my own farts".

Factor in the lack of emotional display while reading text, factor in how stupid people are in general and their overall inability to detect sarcasm, their inability to actually think for themselves, internet is the worst communication platform there is.

Case in point? When did you last time walk into a civilized area with people, engaged in conversation and started to debate like you do on the internet, with low blow rhetoric, ad hominem attacks, TL;DR (TL;DL?) meme, I don't agree with you - downvote! type of discussion? 

Fuck internet debate.
