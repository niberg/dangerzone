The Insensitive vs the Hypersensitive

I am incredibly bothered by how hypersensitive some people can be. There are many examples but I'm going to rant on one in particular. So we were casually watching Archer the other night with friends. One person who has never seen the show asked "which one is pam?" Our natural response (because the episode had been playing off of it) was "the fat one." Immediately the two larger girls in the room took offense to it and yelled at us. What the hell? Relevant or not I want to point out that the two smaller girls took no offense to this and obviously guys give zero fucks.  Also one was the same girl who, when I described my apartment as "looking like a hurricane passed through it", asked if I was calling her a hurricane because she's big. IF YOU HAVE THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM WITH BEING OVERWEIGHT THEN FUCKING LOSE SOME WEIGHT.
