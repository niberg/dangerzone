My friends parents still treat my friend like a child.

Excuse my language but this is a rant and there's bound to be mistakes and excessive cursing.  So my friends 18, still in high school(senior),makes considerable grades, and pretty respectable.  His parents have a history of not letting him do things for no reason at all.  I wouldn't even say his parents are that strict, they're just super lazy and make mindless decisions without giving questions any thought.
   Anyways, tonight we were supposed to go pick up Halo Master Chief Collection at the midnight release and have a good time hanging out.  Yes it's a school night for him, but it's a Tuesday and (him/his parents/I) know that he doesn't have anything important to do at school tomorrow.  Also he has like 4 shop classes.  It's not like him or his parents couldn't have made a sacrifice for one night of pure nostalgic gaming.  I asked my friend if he thinks this continuous path of retardation will go on after he graduates.  He told me that he was in control of his own life.  I replied with, "I doubt it.". And not to mention 85% of the time he has no true opinion when talking to his parents, he'll just fucking agree with stupid they say.  Wouldn't be mad if this shit didn't happen ALL THE GOD DAMN TIME. #DONE #TRIGGERED  

TLDW- Another what was supposed to be a FUCKING GREAT NIGHT turned into another stupid disappointment.
