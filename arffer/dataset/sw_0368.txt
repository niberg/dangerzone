I'm in continual pain

You know when you are lonely and feel pain right in the center of your torso, just below the ribs/heart.

I feel it every day. I want to curl up into a ball and pass out unconscious to feel relief.

I feel empty and alone. I have been wanting to die for a while because I can't stop the pain. I don't know how to heal it.
