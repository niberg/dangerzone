Is there a name for people who desire suicide "rationally"?

Two typical paths for suicide would be  
* My life sucks --&gt; I feel suicidal  
* I have obsessive suicidal ideation -&gt; I feel suicidal

Is there a term for someone who is feeling fine in their life but doesn't particularly care to experience their future, because it might get worse? Someone who doesn't admit to internal negative feelings but feels that their suicide is justified by the imperfect state of the world? Someone who would suicide just to stay in control of what happens?

I usually don't like this subreddit because I am pro-suicide, by and large, but I thought maybe I am not as unique as all that and there are typical fallacies to this kind of suicide wish that I'm unaware of.
