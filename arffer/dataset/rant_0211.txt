Let it go?

Few things bring my blood to a boil more than when people just tell people to, "Let it go."  I'm not referring to the song, that's a completely different thing.  

What I'm referring to is how people think that the human brain is just some magical fucking tool which can deal with loads of trauma and fear simply because the owner of the brain tells it too.  I mean really, you don't go to a vet with PTSD and tell him to let it go.  When a girl is insecure about how she looks and asks for your opinion, you don't tell her to let it go.  When I'm pissed after having a third of my life dominated by you, you can't simply get around it by apologizing and telling me to let it go.  It's not that fucking simple, it's not, and it never will be.
