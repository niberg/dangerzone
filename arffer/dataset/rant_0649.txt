/r/anime and fans in general

What's with these guys! I'm on /r/anime, ask someone a little question regarding the length on a manga(book) series compared to the anime(tv) version, and I'm berated for asking a stupid question. Alright then, I try to brush it off with a joke and they bring out the namecalling. No wonder people were calling it a shithole! Even compared to 4chan's board! I mention that and they say I'm the reason it's bad! Those weeb nerds can piss off! So damn serious on a forum for goddamn tv and movies! I've heard many a horrorstory about anime-cons, looks like anime fans are just as unpleasant behind their computers.
