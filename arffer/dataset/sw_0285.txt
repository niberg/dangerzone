Every morning I wake up wanting to kill myself.

I (22m) am tired. I don't want to keep fighting. I know I'm a strong person but I can only hold on for so long. I'm $50,000 in debt because I was naive when I was 18 and thought if I paid and supported my then girlfriend going to school id be doing the right thing. I have a job that I hate so fucking much but I can't even quit because I'm under contract and if I do quit there's 10 grand Id have to pay them plus I work 15 hour days. I'm away from home for weeks at a time for work. When I'm home I put on an act and act like everything is okay. I recently broke up with my girlfriend because I found out she has been lying to me about something for over a year. My parents just separated and they both are relying on me to be their rock more than ever now. 12 years ago when I was 10 my older sister passed away and I've been flat out told by my parents the only reason they are alive is because I am. Despite this every event in my life is made sad because my sister is dead and thus isn't there or can't experience these things and my parents can't move on. All my friends seem so happy and lovey dovey and it just makes me realize how broken and empty a person I am. To top it off I'm living on my friends floor because when I broke up with the girlfriend I lost the place I was living. 

I know this has become kinda a wall of text but this is just a handful of examples of how much the whole world weighs on me. And I definitely can't get help because I'm a gun enthusiast and if I looked for professional help Id get them taken away, and I just can't let one of the few things I have left that can make me genuinely kinda happy go away.

I just don't know how to escape, all I want to do is disappear forever.
