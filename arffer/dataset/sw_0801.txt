I have no reason to feel this way and yet I just do

I don't know why I want to. I just think about it a lot. And I don't know if I'm depressed. Ive had a lot of bad nights and I just keep messing it all up so now I really don't have anyone close to talk to and I feel like I just bother the people I used to be close to. I try so hard but I never end up succeeding in anything. I never feel like I do anything good with my life. I think of myself like I'm a waste of air. And any time I try to get better and reach out, people just look at me like Im stupid so I shut up and I just don't really talk. And I think about suicide a lot. Like when I'm running, I have often thought about jumping in front of cars that drive by really fast. But I would never actually do that because I don't want to hurt the driver. I just want to die in peace and have everyone forget that I existed. I don't want to hurt anyone, I just want to stop hurting. I just want everyone to be happy because I just make so many people unhappy.
