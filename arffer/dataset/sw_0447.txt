My suicidal father.

I'm 19 years old white male, my father is 55. My dad has had a pretty tragic life and I feel sympathy for him. He and his siblings were rejected by their father and raised in a poor environment, he never really got help for the issues from his childhood I understand its hard. Recently he was diagnosed with being bi polar with ocd. He says being bi polar leads to his problem with prostitutes and the issues in his marriage. For the third time my mother has kicked him out. The past two times she did this he had to be put in the hospital for suicide attempts. The first time he ran down the street with a shot gun(which he still has). He's been expressing suicidal ideation since I was 12. I blame myself sometimes because he says he hates himself for raising a gay son. I don't think I can stop him if he really wants to this time I think the first two attempts weren't real and this time he's serious I don't know what to say I've kind of lost hope for him. My mother takes about ten xanz a day and I don't think that's healthy but I can't stop her. I feel lost and unmotivated to excell any more and I don't know what I would have to do to cope if he bites the lead.
