A collection of tiny rants and unpopular opions

1. I hate it when people say humans are evil. The very fact that our species has developed morality and has made laws to uphold certain ethics is proof enough. Yes, many people are selfish, but if we were inherently evil, society as we know it would not exist


2. I hate iStuff. I hate how a phone that does less makes more money than a phone that does more. I will admit however, that the fingerprint sensor is pretty cool.


3. I hate when people say politicians/government is evil. Running a country of millions of voices and pleasing everyone is impossible. Without government, cooperation would be much harder and the progress of mankind would be drastically slowed.


4. I hate how people think the earth is so fragile that humankind can destroy it by polluting. The era of humans is just a blink of an eye  compared to the earth's life. It has existed long before us and will exist long after. For every dead species two more will eventually take its place.


5. I hate it when people misuse "good" and "well". My mom used to always correct me when I switched the two, now I can't help but do the same to others. I have become a Grammar Nazi asshole.
