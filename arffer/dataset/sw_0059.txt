I feel so worthless

I'm so tired all the time and I have no motivation for anything. I've always had great marks and felt pride in that but now I just don't care. I'm currently doing online classes where I have to check in at a school for 10.5 hours a week and I can't even bring myself to do that. I need to have my course work done by mid January but I don't think that will happen. My mom and I have always been close but have been arguing a lot lately because she thinks I'm just lazy and want to be this way. She's always been my reason to stay alive because I didn't want to hurt her like that but I've realized her life will be much easier once I'm gone. I have a chronic disease and I'll never be healthy. No one will ever love me because of the surgeries I've had. I feel like I have no friends in real life. I'm never going to get into university at this point. I'm going to amount to nothing. Why not just end it now?
