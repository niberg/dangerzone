Ready to hulk-smash EVERYTHING

Husband and I separated in September of 13, told me he wouldnt give me a dime of child support without a court order. 

Filed in January for support, they fuck it up. 

File again, give them his: army jacket, pay stubs, and current support order for his son. 

Given the run around like a motherfucker. 

Get my HEARING for child support in December-11 months after I filed.
