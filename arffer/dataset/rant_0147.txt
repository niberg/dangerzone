Pathological Liar

* Random girl adds me on Facebook
* We start talking, she tells lots of lies
* She says she wants to "more than friends" and she "loves" me
* She keeps lying
* I confront her lies, she gets mad and DENIES that she is lying
* I apologize to her so I can keep talking to her
* She keeps lying
* I write long ass email explaining all her lies in full details
* She STILL denies being a liar

That's basically my TL;DR story but since this is suppose to be a rant I guess I should give some details. Here is our conversation from the second time that I confronted her about her lies.

Me: "Why did you send it to me? I thought you didn't want to talk to me anymore.."

Her: "i still like you.... alot.......but....i thought of you  : /"
(Keep in mind she got a fucking boyfriend on this same day as well)

Me: "Unblock me then and then we can talk more :|"

Her: "no... you called me a lyre"

After she told me that on Facebook I sent her an email with screenshots showing her LYING to me. For example she claimed that her "cousin" "Tim K" was visiting her for a month from Flordia. But a few weeks ago she told me that she met "Tim K" at a friends house and didn't know him before that (as in he wasn't her cousin). And the picture of "Tim K" was from the fucking internet, I right clicked on it and found on a website that said "Cute blue eyed boys"...

She has show me TONS of selfies of "her" that actually weren't her. She showed me a picture of McKayla Maroney and said that it was her.

She said she had soccer practice at 9:30 PM. Keep in mind we are both in high school and there is NO way ANY after school event would start on a weekday at 9:30 PM. Even if it did, at my high school you can only do one sport per season. Soccer is not during the fall season for girls, it's during the spring. And she does track so she could not be doing soccer and track at the same damn time.


I pretty much said all that and pointed out a shit ton of her other lies and I tell her I don't want to be friends with her anymore because she is a pathological liar **but** I'm still interested in being friends if she stops lying. And you know what her mother fucking response is?

&gt;"**i want to be friends too......but apparently i am a liar and you don't believe me....so.....idk**"

I literally don't understand how you can fucking lie to someone and then after they confront you about it you fucking lie about lying to their face.



**TL;DR**
Stupid bitch won't stop lying after I confront her and expose every one of her lies.
