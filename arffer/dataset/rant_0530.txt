I feel like my life is slipping by and I'm in a stuck situation and I can't escape, and it fucking sucks, but I can't just leave.

Right, this is gonna be long-winded, so bear with me, I'll keep everything as short-as-possible, but if you need me to clarify anything just say so.

I'll start from the start:

- Between the age of 5-7, I was molested by an elder brother and, I'm not sure if I'm asexual or not, but I've never been able to be sexual with a girl in-person.  I get extremely frigid feelings and guilty/shameful feelings to the point that I never put myself in a position where a girl would be able to get intimate with me (i.e. I always make up an excuse to *not* go there).  I also grew up in a very Islamic household which emphasised: no sex before marriage, and no girlfriends.  Which didn't exactly help.  I'm no longer religious, but I used to think it was 'against God' to want to engage in sexual behaviours.

- When I was about 12, my two eldest brothers (then 18 and 16) were forced into a marriage they didn't want.  They both ran away from home, and the family sort of broke up.  They returned about two years later: both gave their marriage a try, one went well, the other is going not-so-well.

- My third-eldest brother (who I grew closer with as my eldest brothers fucked off) then left the house as he wanted to party and bullshite, but my Ma didn't let him.  He left at 17 -- I was 15.

- I then became 'man-of-the-house' so to speak and had to balance my G.C.S.E.'s and A-Levels with raising my sisters and paying for groceries and stuff like that.  My Ma was always working.

- At about 15/16 my Da went to visit his Da (my paternal grand-father) in Pakistan: when my Da was on the flight, his Da was alive; when he landed, his Da (my grand-da) had died from a heart-attack.  My Da was already shaking a bit before-hand but we didn't know what to think of it.  He couldn't get work (he was a chef) due to it, but this final blow led him into full-blown Huntington's Disease.  My paternal grand-mother had died from it in Pakistan, but they didn't really know what it was, but turns out it was Huntington's and my Da returned five months later a completely different/broken man.  He was only in his early-thirties.

- That played on my mind once we found out everyone has a 50/50 chance of inheriting it: my two eldest brothers got tested and both have it; my third-eldest couldn't because he was on medication; and I don't want to know.  I think I'd kill myself if I had it.

- That, along with reading *L'etranger* by Camus and learning of the philosophical theory of The Absurd led to me abandoning religion (it was already only a tenuous link by now, but that was the final nail-in-the-coffin).  This led to me being very lonely/lost for a year.  I still haven't told my family, and have no intention to.

- On my 17th birthday my third-eldest brother (the one who got kicked out for partying) phoned the house and I picked up.  I thought he was going to wish me a happy birthday but turns out he was in hospital.  To cut a long-story short he was smoking too much weed and had an episode of paranoid psychosis.  He moved back from and relapsed three times, but he's off the weed now, cutting back on smoking tobacco (on e-cigs) and trying to find work (but nobody wants someone with mental illness).

- My Da's condition keeps getting worse.  I'm fucking sick of coming home having to clean shite off the floor, bleach the bathroom because he's missed the toilet.  Using the toilet roll only to find it has bits of shit on it.  His refusals to change his nappy.  His repeating the same sentences over and over and over and over.  It gets too much sometimes and I find myself crying once or so every couple of months.

- My Ma divorced my Da over the summer there and that just split the family further.  My eldest brothers decided to call her a: 'slag' and all that jazz.  They pitted it as a: "You choose us, or her" argument on me and my younger sisters.  It wasn't as black-or-white as that, but they're knobbers.  Fuck 'em.

- So aye, my Ma only comes by for an hour a day, and the rest of the time is working/with her new man.

- I work full-time in minimum wage, and didn't pursue an education partly because the debt is an issue, and partly because if I left nobody would be there to take care of my Da/sisters.  On that note: raising teenage girls is a nightmare, Jesus Christ alive.  I got the grades for Uni though: 3 B's: B in English Lit.; B in Psychology; B in Geography; A in Business Studies (but that was only A.S. Level (i.e. half an A-Level)).

- I'm scared because I don't know what I want to do in life and all of my mates are now in their third year of Uni.  But I don't know.  I'm just stuck.

- One of my best friends (my best female friend -- my only close female friend) who I'd known since I was 16 and she was 16 (I'm now 20 she's 19) and I don't talk any more which fucking sucks.  To cut a long-story short she admitted feelings for me in May, I told her to wait until she came home so we could talk.  She went on holiday/I went on holiday and our schedules just didn't meet.  She didn't want anything exclusive, but I did.  We agreed that it wouldn't work and tried to go back to how it was, but it wasn't the same as before.  It really sucks as she was the first person I talked to when my Ma divorced my Da, for example.  I miss her dearly.  I've never broken up with someone, but this really feels like one.  It's a month now without talking to her, and sometimes I even dream about her.

- I know she was interested in me romantically as we used to have phone-sex/Skype sex, but never really did anything in person.  And she used to say things like: "Oh, I really wanted to kiss you when we went out" and shite like that.  She was the only person I told about my sexual abuse, and she found my inexperience a sort of issue: 'So you've never done such and such?' and things like that.  I mean, I feel like King Lear said: *I am a man / More sinn'd against than sinning*.  It isn't my fault that I can't do things like that, I didn't choose to be this way.  I mean I *do* have sexual thoughts, and she is the only person I've ever wanted to have sex with.  It's weird but I need to feel *really* comfortable before I can actually think of having sex in-person with them, y'know?  She was the only person I felt that comfortable with.  But even then I was scared.  She offered me 'round her house on the last day of August there but I pussied out.  I said I was Daddy-sitting (which I wasn't, my sisters could've stayed home), I was just too scared.

- The final thing is that my eldest brother phoned yesterday saying he might be going to prison as he'd been constantly threatening my Mum's new fella, and my Mum's got the point that she might press charges.  He told me if I could pay the bills for the week as obviously if he gets arrested he won't be working for his wage that week (it's Â£150 which I can pay no sweat).  But he also told me to make sure his wife and daughter (my niece) are sorted out, and they have another kid on the way.  Why the fuck should I have to take care of that?

-  Also, my third-eldest brother sort of relies on me.  He talks with me which I know is cathartic to him, and if I leave he won't have anybody to talk to.  He might get worse, and I'd feel responsible.

That's all the major problems there are other wee ones, but they're manageable.  I dunno: is this normal?  Any advice?  I find myself lonely.  I gave up on writing and I never get peace enough to read in this house, and it's just hard. 

Any help/advice?  Thanks.  I don't know why I made this, I just felt like venting.  It gets too much sometimes, and everyone seems too immature to talk to and I don't want to annoy my friends with my bullshite.

I'm in Northern Ireland if that helps.  And I'm 20.
