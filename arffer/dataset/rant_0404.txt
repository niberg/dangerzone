Stupid google search engine doesnt give you what you ask for!

Once upon a time, long ago, yes it did. You type in something, and it actually returned results that had the text you type.  But now, it second guesses you, and only returns popular things that it believes (incorrectly) that you probably wanted instead.

Example: A little while ago in another thread, somebody wondered if there was a video made yet of *10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Black Guy*.  So, I did a google search for that.  With and without various quotes, I have no way of knowing if such a video exists because all I got back was pages and pages and pages of the popular video of the woman walking, and the (parody) white guy walking. NONE of which contain the text I actually fucking asked for.

I dont mind the "showing results for... search instead for..." option, or the "did you mean..." option,  because its an OPTION that I can choose to select or not, but I dont want **wrong results** without any way of filtering them out.

Example: Do a search for *[newyork](https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=wM1RVOjWJc7C8geI0oDQBQ#newwindow=1&amp;q=newyork)*. One word, no spaces. You will NOT get back results for that, but instead a plethora of results for the more popular search of *new york*. 

This shit makes it almost impossible nowadays to search for obscure things that have spellings similar to popular things with different spellings. And before anybody suggests it, I've also noticed that the negative sign - before words to filter them out doesn't always work to filter out unwanted popular stuff. Just most of them time, not always.

And google, if I go to the NEWS tab and do a search, I want NEWS articles. Not wikipedia pages or youtube videos.

If I go to the WEB tab, I want WEB pages, not news or youtube videos. If I wanted those, I would have gone to those tabs and did the search there. And stop cluttering up the page with IMAGES. If I wanted images I would have clicked the images tab!!!1!!!
