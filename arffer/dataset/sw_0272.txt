I won't go to your funeral

because you hated people having pity at you.
You were a strong woman. My best friend.

You had huge reasons to do what you did.

But you were wrong!!!!.


There's no afterlife, to find your loved ones.

Your loved ones were here, and each one of us are suffering right now.

LOVE is something we share with everyone in our closed circle. 

There's nothing heroic in going away like romeo and juliet. There's nothing after death. The only thing I know is that your light is gone forever.

All your female friends are repeating like parrots how you did what your did for love, because you couldn't stand your life without the love of your life, and I understand that because I lost the one too.

But what about your mother? your brothers? your fucking friends??

Why there's so many mean people living their lives forever and the truly remarkable people has to go away so soon ?.

I can't forgive you for what you did now. I can't. I won't be there to say goodbye. 

Maybe this can help to all those lonely sad souls wandering around thinking in the worst.

Think for a minute about the people who cares about you !!!!.


My friend. My loved friend. Why did you had to let death win?
Death took away your lover and caused you inmense pain.

Why did you let death play their game one more time?

You were stronger than most of us.

Why did you have to take the path of facing death and look him in the eye, if you knew that you could lose ??

I will always miss you.

The rest of your friends never had the chance of knowing you as I think I did.

I would have supported you in everything except this.

I told you every single day about the consequences.

And this was your way to don't give a fuck about it.

You're gone. and there's nothing I can do now.

Goodbye A.
