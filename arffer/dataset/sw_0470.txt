Im going to kill myself and i feel so guilty about it



Im crying as i write this because ive only just realised how much it hurts, but generally i feel numb. I hate living. Im not doing this anymore. After work, I'm going to kill myself. My partner thinks i-m gonna be taking a stroll after work to calm myself down. I feel so guilty, hes the only good thing in my life and all I do is hurt him. Im so sorry Jake, if you're reading this. I love you so much and this isn't your fault. You were the only good thing in my life.

Update: i cracked and told him everything. He was so upset, it broke my heart. I've been crying on and off all day at work but when I get home we're going to sort everything out. He thinks it's a mix of everything and the miscarriage i suffered earlier this year especially. I'm also late with my period (fucks with my emotions) or pregnant. For my mental sake, I hope it's the first. I wanted a baby so much, but I can't take care of it until I have this sorted. With the first pregnancy I had depression in the first couple of weeks, it's possible I have it again now. Its kind of like pre-natal depression, if I am pregnant.
