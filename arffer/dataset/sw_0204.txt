I'm tired of being alone.

I'm just a 18 year old male feeling alone in this world. I try to be around as much people for it can go away but i cant help but feel really sad . I fuck up everything , even though i try hard to do the right thing . Im in love with this girl, that i know, will never care about me . I hate the fact that everybody tells me that I'm awesome or they like my as friends but outside of school nobody even tries to talk to me . I got myself a girlfriend that i care about , hoping that help me feel less lonely . But i now feel more alone (if thats even possible). i know what I'm going through isn't that bad but is it wrong to only want to be loved. Thanks to all who read this
