I just cant take it anymore

In the last 4 years I have left 3 jobs due to poor management and harassment issues that have absolutly nothing to do with my performance. 
I am a woman and I have been sexually harrassed in 2 jobs. One complaint was dropped and the other is about to drop as we do not have the money to pay the attorney anymore.
My fiancee and I meet at the last job I worked. He witnessed some of the harassment and now they are harassing him to the point is unbereable for me to watch. I am falling more and more into depression. I feel like the employer might know we are together (I am not longer there) and is retaliating against him. I feel hopeless and want to end it.

I love him so much and I feel I am a hydrance and a burden in his life. He placed his own complaint against the company and now an investigation is in place. 

I am so depressed I have a lot of trouble just functioning. I love him and we were planning on getting married but now all I think about is to off myself and save him from me being a burden.
