If I try, then I'll want to live?

I'm back to these thoughts again. But I have hope this time. You always hear about those people who find they actually want to live while they're trying to kill themselves.  Can it work for me? Can it be my impetus for change, to improve?

I hate myself (inside, I'm immature, selfish, and self-centered), and all my efforts to become a better person have been for naught.  I'm serious - I've tried writing, but it just means I'm keeping track of my lack of progress. All my writing has done nothing - I don't learn from my mistakes, I don't take criticism any better, though I want to. I've broken trust with everyone I love, and they've all given up on me.

So I've come to the conclusion that I cannot keep running from these suicidal thoughts. I should just face them, accept them, and see what happens. Yes, it's giving up, but it's better than making the world a worse place and making people I love miserable. 

If it's not a quick death like two of my options, then I've already started a slow death a long time ago with decreasing my food intake slowly every day.
