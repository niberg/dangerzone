I can't bear this anymore.

I haven't felt happy in years. Previously when I tried to end my life back then I got help, but it has changed. Most people I'm meant to be friends with either hate me or I've alienated them. Of the two friends I've told about how I feel, one didn't speak to me again and the other seemed disappointed that I still get the urge to hurt myself before I could tell him I really can't stand living anymore. I hate me, I'm sure everyone that knows me does. The only thing putting me off getting my belt and doing it is the thought of it being my mother who finds me, but I think she'd be okay after a while. I can't focus on anything, when I try to think nothing makes sense. I have no idea how I can end this while hurting no-one.  Hanging myself from my stair rail seams like the only fix left, I have very few loose ends to tie up.
