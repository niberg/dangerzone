I have a fake reality I pretend to live in where I win the lottery

So I have this fake world I live in where I win the lottery, and I've been shopping for houses with money I don't have, I put my min at 2M on Zillow, and look around. And it's taken a dark new turn, where I'm actually getting stressed out, because I can't decided between Chicago, or New York.

Not much of a rant, but seriously, I'm getting stressed over the dumbest fucking thing.
