Can't stand being here anymore.

I'll try not to drone on, because who even gives a fuck really? I'm down to my last Â£20, the job I'm at now is only temporary and working 4 hours a week with half of the weekly pay going on bus fair
.
Some government fuck up has messed up income support, so I've been left with no income for the past 5 months. My savings ran out and I'm basically fucked. I know it all seems about money but I've been suffering with depression for years now recent break ups and moving back in with parents, losing friends etc have all just mounted up.

I can't stop the thoughts and feelings of just giving up and getting out of this shitty world. I don't even know why I'm posting this, always prefer to just bottle it up. Don't have anyone that will listen in person though.
