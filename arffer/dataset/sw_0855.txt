I feel so awful.

I feel disconnected from everything all the time. Like I'm not here. I feel numb. I go between feeling numb, and feeling extremely depressed. To the point where I can feel it in my chest. I don't want to die, but I already feel like I'm dead. I can't talk to a professional because I don't have insurance, or money to cover anything. I'm sleepy all of the time, but can never get enough sleep. I'm so tired.
