Why do I get texts when I don't want them?!

I have been seeing my boyfriend for a few months now.  Why do guys that I had 1-2 dates with months ago feel the need to text me out of the blue, presumably looking for sex.  (some are more obvious than others)  If we haven't talked in months and we both faded away for one reason or another, what makes you think that I'd want to see you now?!

If a girl doesn't answer the first ten times you texted her, then what makes you think she'll answer on the eleventh time?!  If I really wanted to see you then I would have made an effort to see you months ago, and he should have as well.   I'm not going to drop my plans just to see you.
