I seem to have everything going for me, but I just want to be dead.

Im a freshmen in college, and I have a large friend group. They all know about my depression and the fact that Im on anti deppresants. But recently they haven't been working well and Im having all kinds of dreams about ending my life. I want to be dead so bad and it scares me. I don't know what to do. I feel useless and worthless and I stayed in bed until 5 pm today. Its getting bad again.


I don't want to live anymore.
