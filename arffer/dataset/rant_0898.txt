I want to listen to the song I bought from you, not install your crappy software

Dear Amazon Digital,

I have a full-featured desktop computer with broadband internet. Moreover, I am qualified to operate all HTTP client software packages. I do not need a "download manager" or a "library manager" or whatever it is you want me to install. Downloading a file is not black magic and I'm fully capable of handling it all by myself, thank you. NOW GIVE ME A DOWNLOAD LINK DAMMIT.
