Please help me.

I don't know where to begin. I guess I should try to express how defeated I feel. I'm living in emotional ruin, having been used and neglected, now discarded. I spent the last 6 months financially and emotionally supporting my (now ex-) unemployed, depressed alcoholic boyfriend. We split up a few days before my birthday, some months ago ... I had no idea that I'd be replaced so quickly, and forgotten so completely. I gave up so much for him, just about everything I had, thinking I was helping him. And he promised that, when he was in a better place, it would all come back to me. This person owes me thousands of dollars. I'm in debt, depressed, alone. I haven't left the house to socialize in weeks. I can't sleep. And I'll never get any of it back. I was already struggling with Major Depressive Disorder, but this is a blow I don't know how to overcome. I've been thinking about ways to die almost obsessively for the past 2 months. I don't have a gun, so I'm thinking I'll lay under a train. I just can't overcome this betrayal. I think I'm in the final days. Can anyone help? Any similar experiences, any words of advice? I don't know where else to go, or who else to speak to.
