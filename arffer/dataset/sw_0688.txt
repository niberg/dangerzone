Thought about it for a while, always had a reason not to. Quickly all those reasons are fading away and I think about ending it daily.

I've considered killing myself since high school, I'm 28 now. I'm an ugly, slightly overweight nerd with a couple friends a fiancee and a job I hate. 

Every time I thought about ending it I would think of someone I love and it would always rip me back, my mom, my brother, my fiancee, even my dogs. Now none of that means anything to me. My mom only hounds me about getting married, my brother drifted away from me, my fiancee jerks around my emotions, has hit me, is extremely jealous, and my job makes me hate everything around me. 

As I go on and on I dont feel the feeling of being ripped back, lately I don't feel anything at all, even my dogs dont pull me back anymore. Thoughts of suicide went from few and far between, to monthly, to weekly, to daily, now I think about it all day. The only thing holding me back right now is that I'm a coward. I just dont think thats going to hold me back for very long.
