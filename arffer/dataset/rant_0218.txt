Not voting Is exercising your freedom because you are free to not vote if you so choose.

In some countries voting is mandatory, that is not freedom. Do not mistake what I am saying. I have no reservation about the idea of voting, I think its great. However when there are two candidates and you don't agree with either one of them at all on anything then you have no horse in the race. I don't believe in voted for the "lesser of two evils" Staying home and not voting makes a bigger statement about America's disgust with the two party system. This midterm election saw historically low voter turnout.
