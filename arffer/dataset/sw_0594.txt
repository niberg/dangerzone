Work, Eat, Sleep, Repeat

I started medication for depression two months ago and have since taken two weeks of work on two separate occasions. Since I've done this my work have been complete assholes to me, they're treating me like I'm just making it up to get time off work. 

When I came back the second time they issued me with a disciplinary for taking to much time of work(those absences was the only ones I've had) &amp; the store manager has been really condensing towards me, always implying that I don't do enough work, I'm not concentrated enough &amp; in her words "I'm sick of your shit" which caused me to have a breakdown at work.
Since then my manager has told me to leave my problems at the door and come in and be happy. I'm sick of being happy I've put on a smile for over two years. It's hard enough coming to a job I hate without feeling vindicated. I really need some time of from that place but due to my circumstances I can't afford to leave my job, its just one big never ending circle.
