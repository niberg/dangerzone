I thought about it for a while.

I'm 17 years old and I'm depressed. I'd love to get help, but I can't afford it. Today I thought about suicide. I thought about how much better it'd be to not feel at all; to not think; to cease to exist. Then I remember something I read somewhere on Reddit; it may have been here. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. This needs to be said more. It saved my life. I was going to do it. Thank you.
