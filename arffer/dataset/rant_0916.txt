Transferring credits means I should be able to get AT LEAST ONE!

So I moved about a year ago. At my old university,  I gathered +60 credits. I didnt have the right ones to get an AA, but was only a few semesters away. My councilor said they would be fine to just transfer to my new school.

She's a fucking liar.  Not one of my credits transfered to my new school. And not only that, I had to contact my old school multiple times just to get them to send my transcript up. 

I'm rather confused why there isn't a national standard for crediting at least the basics (english, math, etc) so the credits transfer easily, or you know, actually fucking transfer.  If every degree is valued the same no matter where you go, why aren't the classes? I understand that the electives such as film or whatever don't,  but the absolute basic 101 classes should be the same value everywhere.

I've wasted thousands of dollars because I was assured that they would  come with me. And now, I'm not just behind,  I need to start from the very beginning.  I'm a freshman again. 

Now you may ask "if you were so close to your AA, why did you leave?" Well the answer to that is I left for my mental health.  I'm in a much better place, and getting back into school is really important to me. 

It makes me feel like a failure because all my friends are graduated with their master's, a lot of them are working on their doctorates and I'm back to being a freshman.  I just want to scream!
