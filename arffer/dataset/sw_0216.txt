I just keep losing and I don't know how much more I can take

since the end of August I have basically lost everything I cared about in the world. it all started when my girlfriend of nearly 18 months left me. I loved her so much and then without warning she drops the "it isnt working out" bomb on me and wasn't open to discuss our problems. since then most of my friends have abandoned me and I feel lost and alone in this world. I loved my girlfriend so much and was willing to sacrifice everything for her happiness. Now I can't see the point in going on. I wake up every morning and lie in bed and cant see the point of going on. I spend the majority of my  days arguing inside my head the pros and cons of ending it all. 
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore but at the same time I want and need the pain I have struggled with for my entire life to go away and the only way I see that happening is through death. I want to be at peace with myself and my demons, and at the same time I know if I do something bad loke ending it, the few fridnds that have stuck around will be hurt from my actions. 

background context I have struggled with depression since I was 14.
