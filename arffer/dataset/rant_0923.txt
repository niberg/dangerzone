Whacking away at Obama

Ok, i come from MO, this place is like the republic version of ISIS. 
On a daily basis have to see people on Facebook constantly wacking away at obama digging up anything they can do ruin him, like do you people have nothing better to do with your time then to discredit him, or defame his character. In the time frame that i've seen some people do this on a regular basis, one would think that you could have done something more useful with your time, like learn a new language, learn a new skillset, or hell even a new hobby. Yet, to no big surprise they find that "criminalizing him" from sources that don't have citations, let alone no credible sources to attached to this so-called "news" merits the time spend trashing him. Good job America

You have freedom of speech, and rightfully so, but if you are on a regular basis willfully being ignorant of these so call "credible souces" that'll show the world of his misdeed, you are doing it all wrong and you should be ashamed of yourself, for willfully being this stupid.
