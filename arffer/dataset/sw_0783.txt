No idea what to do with myself now

I've been diagnosed with so many fucking mental problems, ADHD, Bipolar I, borderline personality disorder, anxiety. I'm told by the psychiatrist that my ADHD is treatment-resistant and doesn't respond to medication. Then I'm told about a reduced life expectancy/progressive loss of brain power with bipolar. 

I literally cannot get any work done without being distracted. I can't get out of bed because I'm depressed. I have no plans for the future, no friends to talk to right now. I've started self-harming again for the first time in months. Now I see suicide as the only way out of this mess. I'm not going to be able to live with all of this shit. I'm not going to end up wasting away on disability with a pointless life. There's no point to that. 

There is literally no reason for me to continue existing right now, as I'm currently a drain on everyone's resources. I might as well just remove myself from the world to better everyone else. I tried to kill myself last night, but I couldn't even get that done right. All things that could possibly kill me have been removed because of previous attempts. I have no idea what to do now. I'm not looking for replies or anything, just to leave a note that describes my reasoning for ending my life. I hope everyone lives their lives better than I'm doing right now. I wish everyone the best of luck in that.
