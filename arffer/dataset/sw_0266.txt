I feel so alone...

I'm a senior in high school, and after being told my whole life that it gets better, I think I've given up believing that It will. My whole life I haven't exactly been the most happy person. I'm not very social and always keep to myself, I guess that's why I have no friends. I've been bullied my whole life basically for being known as the kid that won't fight back. I'm writing this now because I was recently jumped by the football team after not doing one of the players' book report for one of the players who then failed the class and was not eligible for playoff games (I know that seems straight out of a movie and completely unreal) left with 2 bruised ribs, a black eye, among other injuries. My parents are going through a divorce right now and my mom is trying to manipulate my sister and I to thinking he's a bad father, man, etc. I obviously see that my story isn't as bad as some other people's but I just don't see the point in living a life where I am miserable through all stages of the day. It just feels like I have no one to turn to, and I just feel like I have to fight my way through this alone. The only thing keeping me from attempting suicide at this point is [this] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BI3Fww1vA) song. It's a really beautiful song with anti-suicide lyrics that are really keeping my thinking of the consequences, so if you have a chance you should listen to it, although it may not be something you're into since it's pretty heavy. Idk what exactly I'm hoping to get out of posting this, maybe just venting, maybe someone to talk to.
