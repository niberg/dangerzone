Fuck you Shaw Cable, you Skeevy motherfuckers (think Canadian Verizon)

Simple Rant.  You've seen it before, but I'm on a personal mission to be nicer, more positive, so I have to get this out. 

1.  Get a call, FREE promotion to improve my service (faster internet, bunch of channels, home phone), for 6 months. FREE

2.  Sign up. 

3. Get first bill, it is $25 higher. 

4.  Call support.  Support says "We have a note saying you agreed to pay the extra fees and taxes for this promotion- your services aren't costing you anymore, it is just the fees and taxes that were described to you.  

5.  Me:  No.  I asked a bunch of times and confirmed there would be no extra changes, and that my total bill amount would remain the same.  I was certain to do this.  These calls are recorded, correct?  Can I please speak with someone who can access my recording, and confirm that what I'm saying is true (For the record this is all true). 

6. Support:  I spoke with my manager, and he has allowed me to provide you with a free SCENE package to watch the latest movies at your home.  This is a $35 monthly value, that you will receive for free. 

7. Me:  I have no interest in that package, my interest is in keeping my bill the same as it was before.  It is already a high bill, I wasn't that interested in the promotion, but as your agent described, I had nothing to lose because it was advertised as free. Again, can I please speak with someone who can access my recorded calls.  I simply want to recieive what was promised to me. 

8. Hold on I will go and find the supervisor

9.   **20 minutes pass on hold** **20**. 

10.  Hi there Brighter_Tomorrow, I have good news.  We managed to find a code that will bring your bill down to the original amount for the duration of the promo, and I have applied it, is there anything else I can do for you?

Seriously, FUCK these cable companies.  They will do fucking anything to squeeze a few more dollars out of you.  The fact that I had to be so firm and patient to get this is completely absurd.  I know **many** people in my personal life who would be too timid to go through with this process.  It's utter bullshit.  They explicitly lie.  Fuckers.
