Why can't some people accept that others are introverted by nature?

Good god I cannot fathom why this fact is so hard to understand. I don't go out often, but when I do I just want to have some drinks and hang out. That is the extent of it.

No, the idea of hitting up a strip club doesn't excite me. So don't continue to bring it up all night when I already declined.

I am fine with watching the others do karaoke without me. I have a terrible singing voice and YES I understand that "that isn't the point" or that "noone cares."

And I'm sorry plutonic female friend who came out in our group, I don't want you grinding on me in the middle of the bar. Yes I know you think I should "lighten up and have fun." Your boyfriend is grabbing us some drinks and I don't think having your ass shoved into my crotch is going to make me enjoy the night any more.

Just let me drink whatever mid-tier beer that is on tap and play some pool or darts. Trust me, just because I'm not flailing my arms around or yelling at the top of my lungs, it doesn't mean that I'm not enjoying myself.
