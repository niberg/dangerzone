Now I have to wait longer, because you were too lazy.

I have been patiently waiting for about a week now for my iPad Mini I bought over ebay for a reasonable price (Brand new too). Today was the day the USPS postal man or woman would knock on my door, and require me to sign for the package.
Well I waited all day, I had no classes to go to, so I just sat in the living room and played video games on my PC. Time seemed to go on for forever. 
Boyfriend comes home from work, checks the mail because he has the keys to it, and hands me a pink slip that said TOMORROW I needed to come into the postal office.
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!? I waited ALL DAMN DAY for your stupid ass to hand me this package, and YOU were TOO LAZY to come up to my door and have me sign for it!?!?
This is a big deal for me because its the first thing I've bought with my OWN money that is fairly expensive. 
I seriously hope there is a postal service hell for lazy ass people like you.
Do your fucking job right.
