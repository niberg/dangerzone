Does anyone care about lonely people?

Sometimes I think about how I would trade all of the luxuries I enjoy in my life, just to live in a cardboard box on the streets with a girl I loved. Does anyone else feel this way?

From childhood I was taught that a simple minimalistic life lived with loving people was better than a materialistic one. So why am I told every day to feel bad for people who are wealthy than I am, but never see any sympathy for people like me who are single and lonely?

I'm so desperate I would rather be starving than be alone.

So sometimes I think about why there are so many services in the world to help people who are poor, but I don't feel like an anyone is making a special effort to reach out to help people who are lonely.
After all, people are rarely happy with the amount of money they have and always want more, whereas people in happy relationships say that it is their most treasured possession and don't feel a need for more. It's easy to imagine a poor person getting rich and surrounding himself with more superficial people, and wishing to go back. The grass is always greener on the other side in that way. But in terms of relationships, how often do you find a person living life with someone they love wishing to be single again. It is just so obviously a human need to be happy.

Don't take anything I said here too seriously. I'm just ranting. Obviously poverty is a problem that needs to be addressed and people need to be helped. And I'm mostly thinking about people who are lower class but not homeless and starving. Even though honestly I envy the homeless and starving couple.
