It's so frustrating to feel like this -- especially after years of "success."

Hi everyone/no one/someone.  One day without my low dose of meds and I'm planning my suicide for tonight.  The good in my life outweighs the bad.  But there's still bad.  I'm exhausted from it all.  A new divorce, my career, my health, my family.....my oh my.  I don't know really what I'm posting for other than I think if I type this out I may be able to turn it around.  I've been in the psych ward four times but haven't seen one in almost seven years.  I've been bragging about how I'm an emotional bodybuilder.  Today I feel like a toddler who can't even walk.  I used to use guilt as a motivating factor to feel like shit (effed up, I know).  I don't really have that right now.  I have exhaustion.  I have a brain that tells me not to trust my emotions -- to see the pictures of our universe and to realize how insignificant this life is.  In this insignificance I have found much beauty; today I only find....insignificance.  I am mulling around calling a hotline.  I'm also mulling around getting in my car and finding the nearest cliff (thank you Rocky Mountains for the convenience).  Oh God...I just feel lost.  Again.  I hate this feeling!  I hate it. So much.  I guess that's all I really have to say right now.
