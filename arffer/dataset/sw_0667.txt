completely lost will to live

hey guys-
long story short, With everything i'm dealing with, i just don't feel the need to be living anymore. I've talked to every psychologist, and have a psychiatrist, and took my emergency xanax scrip just now. Between school, social crap, and everything, I dont want to live anymore. 
The only thing stopping me at the moment is my parents, because if i ever did something, they would probably kill themselves too.
