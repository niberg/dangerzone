My girlfriend broke up with me Today and she has already moved on

This girl has been the center of my life for over 4 years, though we had only been dating for a year I was in love with her the entire 4 years and I later learned that she was too. Lately things have been really rocky in my life, my Dad lost custody of us, my sister tried to commit suicide, and I have been going through depression. This caused my Girlfriend and I to break up on her terms though. I of course was extremely sad and this just worsened my depression. Then I realized what was happening I that I wanted to change for the better to keep what was left of our relationship alive. This was going great until for some reason she decided that she didn't want to give me another chance and that she wanted to see other people. This was tonight. I don't know how to handle this as I have no friends other than her. I have no one to talk to about this, and I'm really new to this subreddit.
