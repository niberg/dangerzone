My freaking boyfriend.

His cousin is down from Tennessee so he's been hanging out over at his aunts house to help him fix a trailer, and to play video games with him, they are both gamers.

The last week I have been stuck at home so he could have the car so he could come home when he wants, and I could to to bed when I want and don't have to nag him until he leaves his aunts.

That's been driving me crazy.

So today I drove him there and dropped him off, and then called him at 9:00 pm to tell him to call me when he's ready to be picked up. He tells me he'll be ready by 9:30 so I leave the house at 9:10. I get there and all his aunts, cousin (except for the one from Tennessee) are asleep. Every time I move all four dogs start barking at me, disturbing those who are sleeping.

My bf is in the back room playing Destiny with headphones on, after his match is over I tap him on the shoulder. He tells me he wants to play one more game, I pointed out everyone are sleeping, and the sound of all the dogs barking at me, he keeps insisting on one more game, so I tell him I'm going to the car after repeating no.

He seriously let me sit in the fucking car while he played another game.

What the fucking hell?? I am so fucking pissed off!!!
