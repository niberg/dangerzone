The thing that irritates me the most about a lot of people of my nationality (Iranian)

So I am an Iranian-American, that has lived in both Europe and California throughout my life.

Anyway, I fucking HATE how almost every Iranian immigrant living outside of Iran always has to have brand neame EVERYTHING. I literally don't know a single person in my entire family, both in the US and Europe that does not have an iPhone. 90% of them also have Macs. They just assume if most people want it then it is the absolute best products to have.

I was having a discussion with some Iranian friends today and we were talking about bikes, and all of them immediately went straight to the point that "Specialized is the best bike brand you can own" simply because a lot of people on campus that buy new bikes get a Specialized hybrid or road bike. Apparently I am considered obsolete because I have a new Trek FX bike instead of a Specialized. All of my friends wondered what was wrong with me.

Also, clothing... Seriously WHAT THE FUCK??? All of my family as well as my family friends MUST have brand name stuff. Even if the exact same item is 80% cheaper with a different brand, they will buy the brand name. When my family visits the US they immediately go into the very expensive clothing stores, and skip great stores like Kohl's, TJ Max, Marshall's, etc. My family always asks me why I am not wearing [insert brand name here] pants, shirts, etc.

Seriously this pisses me the fuck off. It's like I am considered obsolete by many of my friends and family members for not "fitting in with the stereotypical norm". Fuck that.
