Fuck Windows 8.1

Just got a new Asus laptop almost a week ago with Windows 8.1. Since then Windows has crashed 3 times, I had to fucking Google to find the hidden 'hibernate' option, windows took 30 minutes to update only to FAIL and is now stuck reverting changes. Hopefully I'm not stuck in a boot loop..

Really, Windows fucking 98 was more stable than this. My laptops specs are rock solid, but this is keeps fucking up. It is insane and tempts me every time to a Linux distro. Jesus fuck Microsoft, get your shit together.

Edit: It did eventually sort itself out after over an hour had passed. Almost 2 hours just to install, fail and revert 13 updates. Almost 2.. fucking hours.
