Apple is a Fucking Pain in the ass.

So I get a $50 voucher, which Itunes lets me redeem very easily on my Ipad, but when I go to buy something I have to enter security questions. 

IF YOUR NOT GOING TO LET ME USE MONEY, DON'T FUCKING PUT IT ON THEIR. NO ONE FUCKING REMEMBERS THEIR SECURITY QUESTIONS ANYWAY, FUCK OFF. 

Anyway, I can just change it, easy, I'll just log into my Apple ID, but apparently I have to change my password. 

I DON'T FUCKING HAVE TO CHANGE MY FUCKING PASSWORD, NO ONE FUCKING KNOWS MY CURRENT PASSWORD. I THINK I WOULD KNOW BY NOW IF SOMEONE ELSE HAD AND/OR WAS USING MY BANK DETAILS. 

But alas, after 5 mins and some mildly offensive language I have changed my password. Now it's time to change the security questions, Apple's support website just says get them wrong a few times and then the option to change them will appear. 

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING? WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A FUCKING GOOD IDEA? JUST MAKE THE OPTION TO CHANGE IT APPEAR IMMEDIATELY, FUCKING CHRIST. 

Okay so after too many attempts I'm locked out of my Apple ID.

FOR EIGHT FUCKING HOURS, THAT'S FUCKING TOMORROW, I DON'T WANT CHANGE MY SECURITY QUESTIONS TOMORROW, I WANT TO FUCKING CHANGE THEM NOW. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHY THE FUCK HAVE YOU MADE THIS SO FUCKING COMPLEX, I DON'T FUCKING CARE. A FUCKING PASSWORD IS ENOUGH, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FUCKING THERE FOR, YOU FUCKING PAIN IN THE ASS. 

TL;DR FUCKING FUCK YOU ITUNES FOR BEING FUCKING PAINFUL TO USE.

Ps. On a lighter note, what can I use that isn't Itunes? (Or Streaming)
