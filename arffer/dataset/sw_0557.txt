In the sea of things to come, there is nothing.

I can't handle life. Some people aren't meant to. I don't know how, but I think I am going to end my own life. Maybe as soon as within the next few minutes...or as far as the next couple of years. Sadness.

This is hard to write intoxicated on ambien. Oh! I see you there! Go fuck yourself. "Oh, that's why he feels down! The drugs and booze!" I can assure you I felt worse when I was stone cold sober. But this state of mind gave me the courage to make this post. NOT THIS CRY FOR HELP!! THIS POST!! There is a difference. 

I hate humanity. A bunch of selfish, shortsighted, arrogant morons who think they are special because they are floating on a small rock within a space that is impossible for people to comprehend. People are just...so stupid. Take a look at the recent elections. Look how most rational people treat their fellow man over FUCKING POLITICS. These aren't just strangers online. Look how friends and families act around that topic. Go fuck yourselves, every single last one of you.

None of it matters. You think it does, but it doesn't. Think I'll be remembered 50 years after I die? 100? 1000? 10000? No. And I don't care if I do get remembered. My point is all of this. It's pointless. It has NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR TIME HERE. NONE OF US ARE IMPORTANT!!

I was not designed to be here. I don't want to sit in an office with a cunt that only wants my money. I don't want to sit in an office with another cunt who wants my money and gives me psychotropic drugs like they'll make everything better. I am the source of my own misery. I am taking responsibility of my own actions. 

I am sad. I am angry. I do not want to be here any more.
