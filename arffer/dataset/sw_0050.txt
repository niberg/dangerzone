I can't suffer anymore.

My story: http://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/2jj56j/broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_yesterday_and_cant/

So since then he cut off every way of contact with me and I honestly don't know what to do, I started to cut but this doesn't help anymore, no matter how much I hurt myself the thoughts about him still come back. I try every day to contact him but it's useless.
