I'm so tired of the fake smiling and lying to people

When people ask "How are you" I just manage to pull of a fake smile and say "I've been worse/better" in a joking/sarcastic tone.

I cant stop It, It's just automatic at this point. I've been doing it for as far as I can remember.

I just wish I could one day answer with a real smile and saying I'm great, but at this point I feel like saying "Well I only thought about commiting suicide X times last night" but the smile and lie is the only thing I can manage to do.


It'll be my birthday next month, the last two birthdays I spent drinking alone in a bar. Oh, and christmas, fuck that holiday.

Now I have moved across the country so I dont know anyone here, I will likely spend it alone again, I'm just so tired of it all.

Family is no help, they're part of the reason I'm feeling this way.

This took 3 hours to write down, I could probably write a book with all the stuff I deleted.
