I've never felt like this before

Throwaway account.

I don't know how to start this, so I'll just get straight to the point . I'm going to end my life. I've never felt worse in my life than I do now. I'm just dismissed by everyone I confide in and was told by a friend that I am being selfish when I tried to ask for help. 

I've attempted suicide before, obviously unsuccessfully, but this time I can tell it's real - I want to let go because there's no way anything's going to get better, but it can probably get worse.

I've made a list of everything I need to do before I go and I'm going to end it next Sunday. No one will miss me and in the long run it's better for everyone. It's the only sensible option.

Bye.
