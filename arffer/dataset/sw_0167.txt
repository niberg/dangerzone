I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me

Just really recently for the past couple weeks I haven't stopped thinking about killing myself. I've been happy for like my whole fucking life but have always wondered what it would be like to be dead, but I feel like it's non stop recently. Like the only bad thing going on in my life is that college fucking sucks but everything else is good. And I keep having these fucking meltdowns too and throw shit and break shit and today I was about to cut myself. I don't want to be like this.

I feel like a pos too because other people have it way worse but idk how to stop this and I don't want to talk about it with anyone I know.
