Can you take Ebola a little bit more seriously?

I currently live in Canada, and reading the latest articles and news reports has me flustered. I understand that people have the right to freedom of movement but can we (as a world) just take a few more precautions against a oh I don't know **Deadly Virus** with a 20-50% death rate?
