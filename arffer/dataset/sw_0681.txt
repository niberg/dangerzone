Final plea an call for help I fear it's too late.

Throwaway not that it matters but I rather her not know. This is my last attempt at looking for help. Me and my gf of 5 years just broke up we have a 3 year old together. But I doubt I can be strong enough for him. I'm not the father he needs or one he can be proud of. I Want to work things out I know she still loves me but not in the way it was before. She's diffinitely the stronger between us 2. I don't think I can go on without her in mylife. As much as I love my son I don't think I can go on. I posted a link on relationship advice to no help. I don't want to do it but I can not handle this pain. She wants to make myself happy before she can consider us again. But she was what made me feel like I was worth something and with her gone all myself worth went along with it. I've been reading and semi posted on reddit before and I have always enjoyed the advice stories, jokes and yes even the trolls. I figure what better place to leave this than here. I'm not leavin a note or anything I will prolly take my life within the next 24 hours or so. I wanna enjoy one last day with my son in hopes it changes my mind but I doubt it will. Yes I know I'm being weak but I'm not the father he needs and I'm not one he will be proud of. I love my son and he deserves better he gas an amazing mother who will raise him well so I have no concerns of his future. Thank you reddit for all your stories and this is diffinitely an amazing site with amazing people. Thank you and good bye.
