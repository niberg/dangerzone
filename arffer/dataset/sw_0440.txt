These feelings.

Are any of us to blame for how we feel? Granted alot of us probably fucked up along the way, but i have seen alot of people fuck up and still bounce back with a smile. Are some of us just meant to feel this way? You can try and look at life with a more positive view but we all know that just does not cut it. I think this is just the way some of our brains are wired. Some people get mad, some people get sad, and some people just want to give up.
