Our soldiers are in need of help

I've been a nurse (male) for 5 years now...I was just at my friends wedding( who served as an army scout) and it talking with some of his old soldier friends.  It sickens me how they get treated at the VA.

It's ridiculous (sorry for typo's if any)

These men/women have served our country. Risking their lives. And they come back to (health care wise) to a load of bullshit. 

I recently graduated with my NP and I want to work at the VA so these men/women get the help that they need. I talked with one army  scout, who I've been friends with on xbox (who I finally got to meet in person) and the process and bullshit that he has had to go through just to get counseling and medication for his PTSD is saddening.

He says that he still wakes up in nightmares and cannot sleep without medication from what he has been through. These men have opened up to me on occasion about what they have been through on occasion through gaming but I can only empathize with them and the hardships that they have been through.

I did a research paper on solder's and PTSD and treatments and I know that so many of them slip through the crack. It's Unacceptable.  There needs to be a change. I hope that once I pass my boards that I will be able to help with this change. 

I don't know what more to say...These men and women have sacrificed so much for our freedom. It saddens and makes me sick how we treat them once they are done with their tours.
