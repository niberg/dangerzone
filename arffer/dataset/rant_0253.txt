Why do movie theaters do this?

You can't go into an R rated movie without an adult if you're under 17. I understand their reasoning, but it's entirely bullshit. If a parent bought the ticket for me, then what's the deal? They should know if a movie's content is bad before they bought the ticket. If they checked, congrats, no problem. If they didn't check, odds are you've seen some shit and some fake blood isn't going to traumatize you. God forbid I see visual art that says 'fuck' a couple of times in it. You know what I could do? I could look at porn. I could effortlessly watch 2 people grinding genitals at the click of a button, but god forbid I watch Joaquin Phoenix moan with a computer. This is why I've torrented movies. You don't want my money? Fuck you. Whenever I want to see an R rated movie, my mom has to buy herself a ticket just to leave as soon an we get seats. She doesn't even get a refund. People my age are watching shitty movies with action and guns and tits. Odds are if I'm interesting in seeing Nightcrawler (it was amazing) I probably behave/am smarter than these people watching movies without seeing a single review.

So in an ADD way, that's why movie theaters are bullshit and I'll continue seeing movies at the Vine Cinema in Livermore, CA (Those guys are really cool)
