Sleeping with the Fishes

I'm not sure where to start with this. I'm a seventeen year old. I am not nearly old enough to be seriously considering suicide. Is this an attempt to reach out for help? Maybe. I'm not sure if I really want help.  I might just want attention. I might just want to tell my story.
            
I'll probably kill myself by the summer of next year. Hopefully. What I'm planning on doing is taking a nice swim in the ocean, or a lake, or a river (I live somewhat near a big one) during the summer. Then I'll drown. No big deal. My parents won't have to find me, neither will my boyfriend or brother. Fish can eat my body and reuse whatever nutrients I might have, instead of my body being incinerated. Sweet.

I've been seeing a therapist/psychiatrist since I was about fourteen. I stopped seeing them for a year, due in part to my parents' disbelief and my failure to scrounge up enough motivation to make appointments. So I've been on different meds for a few months now. They're not working. "But wait, OP!" you say, "There are plenty of other meds you can take! Not all of them work at once!" 

Ok? That's perfectly fine. I'm not willing to wait longer. I've been depressed for essentially all of the life I can remember. I've been abused by the people who were supposed to protect me (parents) and by my classmates as well. Sure, now some people like me. My boyfriend is pretty cool. I feel like he's the only person who genuinely cares about me. We've been dating for just over a year now. I think if I killed myself it would really hurt him, but I can barely live for myself, let alone another person.

I got off topic there. Anyways, I'm killing myself because there isn't a point to living for me. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I've taken up tons of hobbies, none of them too fun. I'm not willing to wait anymore. There's just no point. If you can find some way to help, great. If not, that's fine too. Thanks for reading.
