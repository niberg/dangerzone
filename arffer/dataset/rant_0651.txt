Dress codes piss me off.

I think most of us have had some sort of dress code in our lives, whether at school or work. But most dress codes apply to women. Why? Because guys will get boners if they see our shoulders? That's not our problem. Guys can wear shirts with low cut sleeves and get away with it, but when girls wear them, it's "inappropriate".  And who the hell decided that shorts above the tip of your fingers when held at your side are considered booty shorts? Girls can wear bikinis at the beach and it's fine, but anywhere else... Nope. Another thing, if our bra strap is showing, it automatically turns us into sluts.... I'm sorry, but I'm not worrying about my bra straps showing when I have more important things to do like get work done. Personally, I dress modestly, but if it's 90 degrees outside, don't expect me to be wearing full length jeans and a long sleeved tee shirt.
