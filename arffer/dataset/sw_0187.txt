My girlfriend was suiciday yesterday. She got through it, but im falling apart

Hello there everybody, im 19 and my girlfriend is 18 and yesterday we had a conversation through text messages, and she mentioned she was feeling suicidal and said things like "I feel like more of a burden for the people I care about than anything" and all kinds of things. I hid inside the Wal-Mart bathroom and sobbed while texting her back that life was going to get better abd describing all the ways she had made my life better.

The horrible truth is though, I really am having a hard time not resenting her over this.

I mean, its sick, its awful and its egotistical but I feel like absolute shit. I mean, what kind of boyfriend am I? We have been together a year and talk about getting married and suddenly, I feel as if im not enough. 

Of course, ive had sucidal thoughts in my past myself and have deliberately done dangerous things knowing I might die. But now, I feel like cutting myself over and over again and I just want to get run over and die. And whats worst is I cant talk to my girlfriend about this like I do my other mental health stuff because I dont want her to get worried and feel bad and im trying to keep her as happy as possible so im left with Reddit

So what do I do? How do I cope with this shit? I dont think this sort of thing will come up again for a while, she had a similar thing in July which was terrifying for me and I still shudder looking back on that

BTW:We are in a LDR, so this is why all our communication is texting, otherwise I would have kicked down her door with ice cream and a bunch of kisses
