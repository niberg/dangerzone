I will finish all of the coursework for my Master's Degree in May, but can't walk until next December.

As part of my Master's Degree, I have to do an internship in my field. I already work full-time in my field, so my internship is essentially just do my job, read about 1,500 pages of books related to my field, and write a paper about it after 10 weeks.

For some reason, the internship "course" is only offered in the Summer, but I will be finished with all of my other coursework in May. 

Summer is the busiest time of year for me, and I'm unable to take any classes, even ones that don't require a huge extra time commitment (like this class). So the professor is allowing me to do the requirements for my internship in the Spring semester, but not to turn it in until the summer semester starts.  So essentially, the summer would start, I would turn in all of the work I've done for the internship, and then I would have to wait until August for the class to be completed so that I could get credit for it so that I can graduate.

Technically I can graduate in August, but the school doesn't have enough august graduates to justify a graduation ceremony, so they allow all August graduates to walk in December. But by December, I will have been done with all of my coursework for 7 months, and it just feels kind of silly to walk for a degree that I've had for the better part of a year.

I could just not walk, but this is the last bit of formal education I plan to do in my life. It's a big deal to me to end that with a graduation ceremony as a bookend to the last 22 years of my life that I've spent in school.

It absolutely frustrates me that the school is being so rigid on its policies that they won't allow me to walk in May (despite finishing all required coursework before then), because I can't actually take my "class" until summer, which forces me to wait until December to walk.  There's absolutely no reason for it.  I just want this to be done and over with.
