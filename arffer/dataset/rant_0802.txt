My SO died, I get really fucking irrationally angry when people break up for trivial stuff. (nsfw for some mentions of sex)

Everyone is completely entitled to set their own boundaries in a relationship, I don't want this to come off badly. I know I'm being judgmental, but emotion is currently overtaking logic. 

No sex until we decide to enter a relationship? Peace out. 

Oh, you won't give me a blowjob? Dealbreaker. Not even worth trying to fix.

Oh, you want to study abroad for 3 months to further your education career? Adios, despite the fact that we've been together 2 years and you waited on me when I went to study abroad? Bye fuck you

Gained 10 pounds? Ew. I'm just going to break it off now instead of exercising with you.

Shaved your head to support a friend with cancer? Nope. Nevermind the fact that hair grows back.

Mentions that in 10 years, she sees herself married, possibly with kids? Nope the fuck out of that one.

My friends have essentially encountered all of these things except a few.

I understand that these things are a big deal, but in my mind they are so trivial. I would have went of the ends of the earth for him. I would have stayed with him even if he couldn't ever have sex again. He was far more than my sexual partner, he was my best friend. I'm not saying people have to do something that makes them uncomfortable, but I don't get why the fuck people nowadays are so entitled and refuse to COMPROMISE. Really. I'd give anything for my SO to be here, even if he was pissing me off, because our love is much deeper. He is my life partner and companion. And I compromised because I love him. 

So in conclusion, if you break up with someone for something like that, I am not the right fucking person to complain to. It will make me vomit my organs out.
