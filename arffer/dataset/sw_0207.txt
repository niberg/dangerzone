I need to know how to talk to my niece

Hi guys, I need some help. 

My niece got into some trouble with her parents here lately, she's 13. Her attitude has been terrible, she has to F's and a D, and her father caught her texting her boyfriend about how they can meet up at school to make out. Obviously she got into big trouble, he took her iPhone away and stuff. 

So last night she took 10-15 Tylenol. I feel like it's a cry for attention more than anything, but I need to talk to her about it and I'm not sure what to say. 

How should I handle this? I want her to know that I'm taking her seriously. 

Thanks!
