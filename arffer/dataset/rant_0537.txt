"Redditor" Youtube Comments.

**TLDR;**  Fake neckbeard youtube account owners are dicks.

Getting real tired of seeing these joke YouTube accounts people keep making to comment on youtube videos that happen to appear on the front page.

I saw **many** of those commonly unfunny comments on the Kevin Vickers youtube video (the one where he enters the House of Commons and is applauded and is nearly brought to tears), and had to put my phone down to avoid doing anything stupid to it. Most know of the attacks in Ottawa that occurred yesterday. Most know what the Sergeant-at-Arms did in order to protect the lives of countless government officials, security personnel, and civilians that occupied our capital. 

Now the comments; I understand they are satirical, but what I don't understand is what the purpose is. To be funny. Sure, sometimes I suppose the comments can be borderline OK, funny even. But in the wrong situation and context they come across as just grossly unfunny jokes. I get that it's all a joke! But at what point does a person just push the keyboard away and go have a snack or something without spewing their uselessness over the internet. 

Fuck em, should ignore it but jesus christ the shit is everywhere on every video reddit happens to grab hold of.
