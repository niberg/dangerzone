My girlfriend needs this subreddit but doesn't know it. Help?

Not too sure if this belongs here, but I want to introduce my girlfriend to reddit and this subreddit because she has problems with depression and hurting herself and has had serious thoughts of suicide. We've had some trust issues in the past and I know that if I try to show her reddit myself she'll only really see the nsfw shit and go crazy. What I need is a way for her to be interested herself without me involved at all. I'd really appreciate any suggestions you guys might have.
TL;DR I need a subliminal(?) way of introducing the world of reddit and this subreddit to my girlfriend without her knowing it's me.
