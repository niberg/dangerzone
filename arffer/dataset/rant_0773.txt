Go screw yourself, KTHX!

I fucking hate it when people ask for something in writing and put a THANKS or even THANK YOU at the end.  That's like saying "You're agreeing to this in advance because I want you to do it, right?!"  KTHX!

How about one of these:

1 - having some fucking respect!  KTHX!

2 - ASK!  Does not mean TELL.  Choose one or the other!  KTHX!

3 - Go fuck yourself!  KTHX!

Coincidentally, with years of experience, you always come to find that these people NEVER genuinely say thank you.  And you're lucky if they even GIVE A SHIT that you did something for them.  It's as if they just want to go fuck somebody over for recreational stress relief.

Decent Person:  "Here's that think you wanted, it took me hrs to do, hope you like it"

Asshole:  "KTHX, just put it in the trash actually I don't need it anymore."

Next time anyone ever puts a fucking THANKS at the end of any request that is an official marker that they DON'T GIVE A FUCK and are basically just looking to fuck someone over.  If you want something done for you, respect the person you are asking with a proper request, and remember that ASKING "always" means there is a potential that you will receive a rejection, so don't fucking say thank you before you've got your response.  Say it AFTER.

And most importantly!  Go fuck yourself!  KTHX!
