This week my (ex) girlfriend broke up with, told me to never speak to her again and wished I kill myself and I don't know why. I've worked my fucking arse off all month and still don't have the money for rent and to top it off it's my birthday in a few days and I can't do fuck all. Fuck this week.

Tell me about your week.
