DayZ

I have never seen such a poorly copied piece of shit like DayZ. It's been copied so terribly so many times and today I saw a brand new shitstain of the toilet bowl of the internet called Miscreated. I looked at the store page on Steam and I saw that it's literally the exact same game. If someone showed me 3 pictures that are supposedly from DayZ, Infestation, and Miscreated, I really bet I wouldn't be able to distinguish between them. Seriously, who the fuck wants to play the exact same thing, literally the exact same thing, over and over and over? I can't even fathom the kind of fucking idiot that could ever want to play DayZ 3 times. I hear so many stories about people getting shot on sight for no reason, so many shitty fucking glitches that lead players to dying for no reason, and it keeps getting copied for some reason! My friends defend all these shit games, too, saying that they're not the same when they are! They've all got a huge forest, zombies, other players, and jack shit for anything else. *This* is why the game industry is failing, because of shitty fucking games coming out again and again and again with 0 changes. Call of Duty, Mario, DayZ, and fucking Minecraft games. They never leave Early Access, they for some reason have shitloads of players that have the average brain size of a nut and think good game design is "DURR I LIKE GUNS I LIKE PICKAXE I LIKE CRAFTING I LIKE **THE EXACT SAME BULLSHIT OVER AND OVER**"
