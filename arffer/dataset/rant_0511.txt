Scumbag T-mobile employee

So I'll give you a little background information first. I'm from Canada and while I was on vacation in the states earlier this year I decided to get the T-mobile $2 pay per day unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited 2G plan (http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans). I must've had at least $30 remaining on my account after my trip.

Now a couple of weeks ago I was in Chicago for an extended period of time and thought it would be great to use my T-mobile account. I slipped the sim card into my phone. It didn't work. I went to the T-mobile store where the representative told me that the $2 pay per day plan no longer exists, and that my account from earlier this year had expired. I even asked her if she was 100% sure about the $2 plan because when I first tried to get the plan, that rep had to ask her manager about it because she didn't think it existed. So the T-mobile rep said she was sure. I took her word and left without causing a scene because at that moment there was nothing else I could do but accept my fate. 

Just now I stumbled upon phone plans and saw the T-mobile website I linked above and could not believe that the bitch employee at T-mobile fucking lied to my face. I went almost a week without data in a foreign city because she lied to me. I didn't know about the Chicago marathon because she lied to me. I had to drive around like a mad woman because I didn't know the directions to avoid the marathon because I didn't have data because she lied to me. I had to specifically sit in places with free wifi to stay connected with the world. 

If T-mobile rejects me again when I go there this weekend, I'm going to flip out on them and tell them that they fucking suck at their job.
