Were you abused? Or depressed?

Is there anyone on reddit that was not abused in some way ever? I feel like in every fucking post where people whine about some problem they have, they end it with "I was sexually/physically/mentally abused" therefore they are somehow entitled to more sympathy from you people.

The other thing is depressed. Every other person on this fucking site is "depressed." Coincidence? I dont think so.

STOP ABUSING THE WORD 'ABUSE'!!!!
