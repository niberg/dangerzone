I really can't hang on much longer

I  can't. I have nothing to live for. There is no point. The only time I am not crying is when I am sleeping. I want to sleep forever. I want him back. Nothing else makes me happy. I can't believe he found someone else - and an addict at that. I know he's still sick, but fuck. I can't do this anymore.

I don't want to do anything. No one wants to hear it anymore. I wish I could just die already. Clearly no one wants me around and I am worth shit to those that matter most to me.
