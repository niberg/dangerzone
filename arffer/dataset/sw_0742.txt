Story of my life

I keep having amazing opportunities presented to me, and I work and work to get them. Then, in one moment, I say or do something that completely fucks it up. I undo everything, and wind up worse than when I started. And it hurts to have hurt every single person around me this badly. There is not a single story in my life that if you follow it from start to finish, doesn't read: he got so close, and then he fucked everything up.

I'm not contemplating taking the cowards way out, only because of how it would affect the people around me. It's not that I value my life at all, I just couldn't have my last act be something that would devastate all my friends and family.

This song is the only thing that is keeping me here.
