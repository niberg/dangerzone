Childhood friend is finally starting to snap

I have a teenage friend who I'm genuinely scared for. They have been depressed (won't admit or get help though) for the past couple years now and I think they've finally had it. I've tried to get them help. I've quietly talked to their teachers, encouraged them to participate in activities outside of school with others, and have even tried to talk to their school counselor for them although they found out about the counselor one and threatened to "end" me if I tried it again. 

They just sent me a message saying they will leave soon. Following this is the mention of pills. They've never, not once, have mentioned anything about leaving or means of suicide before. I know it's best to get yet an adult involved but they would be furious with me and would break off our decade long friendship. They're one of my closest friends and I can't stand the thought of them hating me like that. I thought I could help with the methods I've been using but it's gotten worst. Please, I'm only a teenager myself. I don't know what to do. I don't want to get adults involved but I don't want them dead either.
