Can anybody relate to my depression or share an idea of what I can do to feel again?

I'm not sure what's going on with me. For the past two weeks I've suddenly lost all desire to live. I have absolutely no point in being alive. I have no idea why I'm even still alive right now. I feel all alone in the world despite the fact that I have friends and family an hour away. I just have no desire to live or do anything and I feel so hopeless about the future.

Has anyone out there ever felt this empty? Just... nothing in me.

I work in an office and attend a few college courses a week
I'm falling behind in both work and school because of the apathy that accompanies the depression
