You would think medical marijuana in Florida was the spawn of satan

My local media outlets have both come out with editorials against amendment 2 in Florida, which is for making medical marijuana legal. I know some of these guys - they're smart dudes working for these papers, but of course in a state like Florida, the idea of medical marijuana is somehow something that has to be looked "critically" and not with a passing thought of "gee, marijuana isn't that harmful and has the potential to help those who suffer from chronic pain. Let's allow it!"

I mean, one of the editorials even references the fact it's a schedule 1 drug, which is the biggest load of bullshit ever (again, I expect these guys to be smarter than this) and somehow references the pill mill problem in Florida, yet fails to understand how pharmaceuticals are 100x more deadly than marijuana.

More than anything I'm pissed about the underlying tone of the whole debate, something set by these social values motherfuckers - the people who think the world will go to hell if people can smoke marijuana, even if it's for medicinal purposes. One of the editorials talks about how there aren't requirements for parental consent for teenagers because god forbid a teenager gets their hands on a mostly harmless drug.
