how do you carry on?

nothing all that terrible has happened to me per say, but i've just been coming to alot of dark conclusions about the world itself. why live in a world where:

- people only want what they can get from you?

- no one will listen even if you listen to every complaint they've ever had in their lives? 

- all we care about is leaving good and comfortable lives rather than meaningful ones.

-we only care about getting ahead of other people.

- no one will give you their time no matter how much you give

- your hard work goes without reward, but empty and mindless work is praised

- there is no empathy anymore

- there is no order

it just has gotten to the point where i would rather spare myself all of the pain and jump to the conclusion. you cant tell me that the good in this world out weighs the bad. over the past 6 months, these things i have listed off have cut me in an extremely deep and profound way. you can tell me that there are good people out there, but i don't think it's worth the trouble of finding them.

why shouldn't i just take the razor blade, press into my throat, and drag it across when i think about these things every night.
