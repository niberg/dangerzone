What's the point anymore?

For most of my life i have suffered from depression. No one knows because I constantly put on a face to hide it and I dont want to tell anyone because if I do kill myself i want them to remember that person. Only one person in this world knew. There was only one person I could talk to. That person was a girl who I had a very close relationship with. An ex girlfriend 

Yesterday she tells me she is developing feelings for a man who she had previously hung out with when we were together.  A man she promised me she would never have feelings for. I want her to be happy but i was left with a decision.  Lose the one person that understands the real me, as I would no longer be able to speak to her since she wants to date this guy. Or force her to not see this man and have her be my friend but have her hate me at the same time. 

Thats when i found a third option. Just letting go of everything. Inches away from doing it i just broke down. I called the scuicide hotline. whats the point of going on if my depression gets worse and worse? Whats my reason to live? Everything is boring now or requires too much energy.
