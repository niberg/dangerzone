The dog across the alley will not stop barking.

My schedule in life works out so that Monday is the day I can sleep in. Classes start late, work is even later, today is my day to sleep in. It has been ruined today because one of the neighbors across the alley has a dog that barks non stop. There isn't a threat, nothing, it's just a dog that barks the whole time it's outside. 

When my dog starts to bark at something, I make her come inside immediately. I don't want to listen to your dog barking, I don't want you to listen to my dog barking, but apparently you're too shitty to care about your dog barking.

You have successfully ruined my Monday, the best day of my week.
