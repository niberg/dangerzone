I Feel Powerless

I'm a Junior year physics major at a small liberal arts college.  I have a girlfriend who I've been with for 3 years. We both live at our parents' homes and commute to school. This semester: 
1. My dad started dating after 4 years of separation with my mother. I'm not upset about this, but she likes to talk about how disgusted she is by the new girl. My mom dated someone less than a year after my parents separated, but according to her my DAD is the disgusting one. 
2. My mom will do nothing but complain about how stressed she is every time I see or talk to her. 
3. My Physics II class did not adequately prepare me for my Junior-level course. It has been a massive struggle to learn both the old and new material. 
4. I've been sick 4 times this semester with respiratory things. 
5. My girlfriend found out she has a 6cm cyst on her ovary. She was told she would have to have surgery on Halloween. 
6. JUST KIDDING. Her dad changed jobs. The first job ended early this month and the company terminated insurance that day. The new insurance doesn't start til Nov. 1. 
7. She has to schedule a new surgery and her professors don't want to let her make up tests. 
8. I'm trying to be there for her, but I feel powerless and it's driving me crazy.
