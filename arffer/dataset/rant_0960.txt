You want a rant? Here's a fucking rant.

People and their incessant collective stupidity...

I am so fucking sick and tired of all the bullshit and stupidity in this world, so if you belong to one of the following groups of fucktards, kindly assassinate yourself gloriously and make arrangements for it being posted to the internet before you shove off this digital mortal coil.


**The Opinionated Ignorant Many**

To everyone who believes something is true simply because one of their stupid fucking worthless dead ancestors told them once, and have never been bothered to research their asinine position for the greater good of everyone who will ever be the victim of their audible stupidity now and forever more, fuck you. I hope you die.


**Fat people**

To all the disgusting, stinky, water-displacement champions of earth, I have surprisingly little to say. You're too fat, and you'll die prematurely, because you eat too much and don't exercise enough. Before you break out your fat hand of excuses, I've witnessed a 75 year old man with no real legs walk into a store and say, "You see that? They're in a wheelchair. I have no legs, and I walk."

**"Non-fattening"**

You hear them say it. They're already obesity range, and they're acting concerned that foods with 18,298 calories have too much fat. Oh, no. They're fattening! Nope. Big bag of nope. Better eat 3 anyway and cry about it.

**"Sugar-free ice cream"**

"My grampy is 89 years old and his doctor said he can't have ANY sugar whatsoever and..." Okay. Here. I'm not going to bother to explain to you that there's no such thing as sugar-free ice cream, and if there is, you sure as fuck wouldn't want to eat it. Instead, I'm going to shove this bullshit "no sugar added" horseshit down your fat purple rotten-ankled ass until you get the fuck out of my face.

**Politics**

When you take a political side, you agree to fuck everyone, including yourself. Think about it. What good has politics done for you lately? Think you know your shit? Look how much you paid your congressmen and senators, what they've voted for, what they've voted against, and what they've actually changed for you for the better. What they've actually done besides pay themselves and take vacations. Yeah, fuck off.

**Video games and gun violence**

This one makes me so fucking mad, I just want to go play a fucking violent video game, to pump myself enough to actually go out and shoot real people. Keep taking guns away from those poor stupid fucks who actually want to follow the laws for some reason. That'll show those gun criminals!

**Religion**

I am not an atheist. I once considered myself one, but then I realized that was just as assholical as declaring there must be god and other people are going to be punished solely upon what I believe. Fuck that. I'm just going to live my life and give my care and concern to those people who bother to transcend primitive baseless ideas. Morality comes from empathy. Nothing more, nothing less.

**Thug fucknuts**

You think you're fucking tough shit with your 5th grade education and your love of stupid violence and idiotic firearm discharge? Come see me sometime, you nigga ass broke down child support-paying sack of potato envy. I just hope you bring some fucking ninja skills that would make Chuck Norris cry, and some next-level chemistry knowledge, because you're gonna fucking need it, bitch.

**Fossil fuels**

This one gets me the worst because there is actually a very simple solution, but because of the aforementioned bullshit, it'll never happen because you'd rather kill yourselves off and destroy all life on the planet instead of opening our fucking eyes and making an effort to change things. Why can't I do it? Because of all you fucking oppressors. Let's ignore global warming and the proven scientific damage it is causing, so old fuckers with new money can make some more billions to go with their billions. Nevermind that many people live in subhuman conditions because of these ignorant fucking beasts hoarding and controlling the banks and the economy. So, what's the solution? 10,000 words for you: hemp. No, not marijuana, you fucking wasted Cheetos investors. Fuck that shit, legal recreational cannabis is for idiots. I'm talking growing cars out of the fucking ground. Hemp can repair all the damage you fucktacular imbeciles have caused with your stupid fucking ignorance. Everything that can be made from fossil fuels can be made with hemp, and we don't have to destroy anything to create it.

Fucking stupid people. Wrapped up with your pursuit of money, fame, and idiotic cretin endeavors. We live in a world filled with teenage-minded entitled psychotic bigots because of you. Fuck you. Die.

Edit:

**Same sex marriage**

Who really fucking cares if two consenting adults want to get married? Dumbass scared little smallminded bigots hiding behind some bullshit religious scapegoat. They can't have kids? Lets persecute infertile man woman couples and leave orphans on the street to die while we're at it. It's disgusting? Fuck you, you are the only person who can give yourself permission to feel offended. Fuck off.
