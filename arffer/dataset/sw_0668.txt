I give up on finding happiness.

I haven't ever said anything before to anyone about how I feel im one of those "i don't cry" guys. For my whole life ive been over weight and felt out of place. Growing up in a very active community didn't help, also with snotty kids. In high school i lost some weight so with clothes on I look normal but still mad and angry at the world. Mainly because no matter what I do only bad things come back to me. Socially awkward, ugly I guess only one girl told me she liked me but that was before puberty like grade 4. People don't directly pick on me but give me hints very very strong hints. Im at the point now where all I want to do is hurt myself or someone, I don't care and just want to be done with it. Whats the fastest was possible?
