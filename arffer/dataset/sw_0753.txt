I don't know what to do

I'm not going to go into detail but I lost someone that I love more than anyone in the world and I still believe I can't live without her.
I've been prescribed 100mg of zoloft and it's way past the point that it's supposed to have "kicked in" and I still can't even tell that I am taking it, I still spend a maximum of 2 hours asleep at night and when I do sleep I just have dreams about when things were worth living for so I just feel even worse when I wake up, it's gotten to the point where I'm quite scared of sleeping. I'm losing a lot of weight as my appetite is just gone, I eat toast on a morning and then I just don't want to see food for the rest of the day. I stay in my room and try to sleep as much as possible, I don't want to leave my room because my parents shout at me for being unhappy because it's apparently selfish. I'm really lonely, I'm just exhausted all day but can't sleep, and I'm just so miserable and I don't know what to do when I can't have the person I love so much. Everyone says I should spend time with people to distract myself and move on but I just simply don't have anyone to spend time with, she was the only the person I had to spend time with
