This got me so angry that I almost punched someone today.

Today I was at the hospital to see my gyn for a follow up on my ablation. He was holding a clinic day and the hospital was closer to me so that’s why he booked me there.

Anyway I came painfully close to actually punching someone in the face today. I mean quite literally shaking with rage, and my blood pressure was very high and it concerned the nurse. I told her “no it’s not normal, I’m angry” “Oh okay…” and she just didn’t put the reading down, it wasn’t really needed anyway.

What set me off? Well, as I sat down in the waiting room, an obviously pregnant teenaged girl waddled in. She was mentally challenged. I mean she talked like an eight year old, she acted like an eight year old, she was carrying a barbie doll ffs. She had the mental capacity of an EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILD. Here she was 28 weeks pregnant.

Her MOM was bleating to the nurses about how she felt so blessed, and it was a gift from God that she gets to have a grandbaby to play with and all that bullshit. I mean with every self aggrandized piece of bullshit that flew out of her mouth I got one inch closer to punching her nose in. She didn’t give a flying fuck that her daughter was raped in order to get into that condition.

She didn’t give a FUCK that her daughter had no fucking clue as to what was happening to her or why.

She didn’t care about that child, only herself. I mean it. I wanted to really beat the living shit out of her. I’ve NEVER been that angry before in my life at someone. I’ve been angry, but never to the point of walking up to someone and cold clocking them in a hospital.

I’m calming down now. But my heart is with that poor child…I’m glad my gyn took extra time with her, even though it made him run late for my appointment.
