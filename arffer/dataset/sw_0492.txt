I don't see why I shouldn't throw myself onto the train tracks

I'm fat, ugly, I have bad teeth, I've only had sex a couple times and already have an STI at 22, I'm not smart, I'm pretty slow, I have a hard time figuring things out, things like reading, spelling and even forming sentences at times is trouble.



 when I'm alone I hear people talking to me, telling me to hurt myself, go to the train station and jump, every second train skips passed so it doesn't slow down. I don't like being around my friends because all they do is drink, smoke, do drugs and fuck each other, I;m constantly uncomfortable and feel out of place, and when I try to join the conversation I get called out for being rude. 


I have been trying for YEARS, to find a job: Target, Kmart, grocery stores, telemarketing, night fill, data entry,  retail. no one will have me, even "entry level" jobs won't have me. I'm too dumb to go to uni or community collage and with the education changes happening will effect students even if they were enrolled beforehand.


I'm too unfit and lazy for the air force.


I'm so bad at trying to find a job, I have to volunteer to keep getting my unemployment payments, half of which I give to my mum . when I was told I had to volunteer, they already had a thing signed up where I had to rip up weeds in a nearby graveyard, known by many, including my friends as a place to have sex in. I got a volunteer position at what I think is a homeless shelter.


if someone where to ask me, what do I want to do in life or where will I be in 5 years, I don't know, I have no ambition, I don't WANT to do anything, nothing really matters to me anymore, every day I can't think of a reason to get out of bed, I have no reason to get up, I just want to sleep forever
