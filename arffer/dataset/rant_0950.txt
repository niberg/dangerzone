'We took too long to make this page for you' - Fuck off Reddit, you didn't even try

I'm aware this is just a faceless page to cover up how the Internet actually works, but it still manages to get on my considerable tits. The false apology just comes across as insipid. 

Especially when it seems Reddit doesn't even try - cutting to that apology page in a microsecond, which is significantly shorter than it takes to actually open the page I want.

But more to the bloody point, **I don't care if I have to wait a moment**. Seriously, Reddit. **It's fine**. Just shut the hell up and give me my fucking webpage at some point.

I. Just. 

**Cunt gargles**.
