Something positive

Too many sad titles. I thought about it last week, and came very close. And now I'm waiting on my family to go to bed before I drive to the store and buy the pills. I know the brand name and I have a bottle of vodka sitting on the table adjacent to me. No more worry about school, no more worry about loneliness, a choice made just for me. My whole life has been dealing with everybody else's decisions and now you all have to live with mine. I've been the poor unlovable fat kid my whole life, and so much of it has been out of my control, but now I can and WILL do something about it. If you wanna talk, I would love to hear something from someone.
