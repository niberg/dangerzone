Rant about Racism

It is not debatable that racism is still alive.  Something that irritates me more than anything is that people keep it alive. Whenever something bad happens with a minority (especially African Americans), there is always some outrage.  Most recently, the shooting in Missouri of a black man has made the news.  Let me go ahead and say that it its absolutely terrible that that happened, no lives deserve to be taken.  However, what does bother me more than anything is the protests that ensue after this.  Everyone is against the police that shot him and wanting "justice", but do these people not know that the guy shot at the police as well? Where are the protests for white people that get shot? Oh, there aren't any? The people that are marching the streets for a guy that had gun charges, and many other charges as well are proving that racism is alive because we keep it alive.
