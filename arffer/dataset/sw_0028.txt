I want to start over.

I didn't win the lottery two days ago, although the number drawn looks quite appealing and easy right now. It makes me mad, it makes me sad. that I can't take that money and change my life.

I can't avoid comparing myself to others. life isn't fair, and I don't know how to continue with all that unfairness. People are born to rich parents, get a certain education, born in the US/UK or have both citizenships. I was born in Israel and I can't get myself out of here, immigration laws won't let me move and get a work visa, showing an interest will get me deported. I was forced to serve in the military (waste of my time and money), people are getting killed here daily and everything is corrupted. but I mostly care that I haven't found my place as a person or friendship or relationship. I had a decent high earning job (for every standard) and some kind of life, but still didn't manage to just have friends or a girlfriend that will care about me. I slowly began to drift away from work, put on a lot of pounds instead of losing them and eventually got back to live with my parents at 31. my psychologists in the past only took my money and made things worse, either tell me that I won't succeed in accomplishing my dreams or just say that they feel sorry for me.  

Now, other than not ruining my parents life, I have no reason to do anything in my life or keep them. I can't restart them, I can't win the lottery, I can't move to somewhere else that will make me happy. Every time I visit L.A., NY or Europe... I'm a different, happier, person. the sudden freedom of new people to meet, no religious restrictions food or otherwise, living.

I hope that someone will kill me soon.
