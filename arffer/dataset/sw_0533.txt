I hate Myself

- In my late 20's
- obese
- Unemployed for three years
- major depression
- never had a best friend, no friends at all
- never have been in a relationship
- live with parents who bitch about why I suck at life, but love them and they love me. just wish that I could help them pay their bills since I'm living with them.
- massive personal debt from college and credit cards (being paid by parents, or what they can)
- no self-confidence
- no plans for life. Have no idea what i should do with myself career wise
- I fake my happiness in front of others

I feel horrible, that I'm basically taking advantage of my parents to get through life right now. I now that I should be looking for a job, working on a career, making a life of my own out on my own but at the same time I don't think anyone would want me/ hire me though, I weigh like a ton and look like a mack truck. I have a 4 year business degree but that hasn't helped me one bit in this job market. It's been a while since I've been on job interviews and every time I go to one I can feel them judging me with their eyes about my weight. That if i can't take care of myself then how can I be trusted to help run their company, which is bullshit since I have been loyal and dependable to everyone who has ever needed my help in my life. But now after being unemployed for so long I also fear them wondering what the hell I've been doing for so long on top of my weight issues. So I just sit at home all day like a coward and get myself stuck in a depressed catch 22 where everything that would make me feel better are the exact things that are the hardest for me to do.

fuck
