And here I am again.

So, I've had a shitty life full of shitty things. I have been a drug addict, a whore, a headcase and abused. Every time I have tried to get my goddamn life on track, it blows up in my face.

How long does this shit go on for really? It gets into my head so much I feel like I cant breathe. I don't want to breathe. I don't want to be here.

I'm tired of being a fuck up. And I'm tired of all of the things in my life haunting me. I've tried so many times before to take it all away, but I never works. Every time, someone saves me, and then gets on this whole moral high ground on how they helped me and that I should start taking life more seriously....

If I didn't take it so seriously then maybe id have second thoughts about wanting to take my life. And maybe if people stopped getting in the way it would be over by now. What is the point. I cant live with what I've done. There aren't enough hot showers to wash away the filth that still finds its way back. 

I just don't want to play anymore. I'm done, and I'm tired. I've lived my life for 10 of me, isn't that enough?

If there was a god, how could he have let a once smart intelligent and ambitious little girl have parents who hated her, had friends and partners who used and abused her and her trust until there was nothing left and then throw her away when she was undesirable and worn.

I fucking hate this. And they're always screaming at me, telling me to just fuck myself up good for the last time....this time, i might just listen.
