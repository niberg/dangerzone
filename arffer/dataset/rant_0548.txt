friends? I think not.

I'm really depressed right now, just because I'm overthinking about the fact that maybe my "friends" aren't really real friends. I think they are "friends" with me when they want to talk to me or ask something from me, and they are not when they don't want anything from me. I know this is not a "guy" thing to do but yeah I'm ovethinking about if I really do have real friends and how my friends think about me and if they really want to be friends with me.
