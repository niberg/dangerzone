Tired of months of waiting lists, Can't handle any more, UK/NHS can't help.

For the past 6 years I have been taking meds for severe depression, anxiety and some OCD tendencies. I have been on fluoxetine (prozac), Starting at 20 and going up to 60mg a day. After a very hard month with several nasty surprises I hit something of a breakdown. After seeing a crisis team and an emergency GP appointment a few months back I was put on a waiting list. The meeting with a pysch nurse went no-where and now I face another month at least with no help. I'm sitting here praying my GP calls back and wondering why I shouldn't gas myself tonight. I don't think I'm going to get any help from the NHS and I don't think I can afford private care. I'm 25 and spent my entire childhood in horrible pain due to a genetic defect in my ear. I skipped the last half of highschool because I couldn't handle the anxiety any more or the panic. I can no longer handle the obsessive thoughts I have been getting the past 2 weeks, I'm scared that I'm going to hurt myself or someone. I spent 2 hours fighting the urge to strangle my dog to death, who I love and has been a friend and companion to me and my family since we got her. I'll kill myself before I do that, or to anyone I love, I swear it. I don't have anyone to talk to and I don't know who to turn to. I'm just scared and fucked up and want my brain to stop. I might get made an inpatient if I can convince anyone at the hospital how bad I am.
Even if I can somehow find someone to help me fix my broke fucking brain I'm still 25 years old with no education, no contact with girls since I was 12 and lived in a fucking basement for my entire life. So tired of being scared of everything, think it's time to just admit I lost.
