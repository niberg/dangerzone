Woohoo the american dream.

Just got off from my job at walmart making minimum wage. My wife thinks im constantly cheating on her for some retarded ass reason.

 Im a military vet and got into the nuclear program for the navy got diagnosed with crohnes shortly after and got medically retired. Went back to school at a shitty community college. 

Almost died from my disease a few times now, a couple of times due to medical malpractice.

Quit school and ran a company for a year at the age of 25 before i found out my father emebezzled over 200k from its accounts. Now i live with my mother inlaw and fuck me if my daughter isnt the only thing keeping me going.

Tldr: i fucking hate me.... hopefully this vodka makes me feel better.
