Why did you have to steal from me on your own birthday?

you've been counting your birthday down for months now. so why, on the eve of your 21st birthday, did you call me up to watch the dog while you run to the gas station only to go into my room and steal weed you know i worked my ass off to get? its not a matter of me mistaken, i am 100% sure i was stolen from. did you think because it was your birthday you wouldnt get confronted? ive been feeling hurt, stepped on, used, sad, betrayed, (even though this is far from the first time youve stolen from your family) and i even feel guilty because its your birthday and even i didnt want it to be like this. we've grown apart a lot in the past two years, ive made my own mistakes but i always admit when i am wrong. you never say sorry. you just leave me to forget because sorry would be admitting something you did was wrong. i told you i dont look up to you as an older brother anymore. your tendencies to lie and steal seem almost compulsive. every time i think it'll be the last and just when me or mom get comfortable again, you steal from us to remind us. so now here we are on your birthday, mom trying to mediate between us this completely childish conflict, (are we too old for this yet?) in which there is no winning side for her to take. you of course scream and deny. you always, always deny so its almost given. obviously she believes i was stolen from but its your word against mine and that leaves me out to dry pretty much. i mean what can she do? you do whatever you want and you never feel any consequences so why should you change? you'll never know how many problems you cause me, and how much pain. this is why i go to therapy. you're the number one trigger to my anxiety. when you are around there is a pit in my stomach. you actually make me sick and right now im just glad i can be alone all day and i dont have to show up to your stupid birthday dinner. just why did you have to make it like this? fucking why?
