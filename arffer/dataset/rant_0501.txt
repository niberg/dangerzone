To all the rich fucks and rich fat fucks.

All I would like is to be able to eat healthy and workout every day but shits too expensive these days and there's people who abuse food and don't even workout . I mean that's like putting supreme gasoline in a car then driving it in circles , what a waste. Seriously fuck being broke , if I had  minuscule amount of money I could do cooler shit than at least 99 percent of people I just need to get into even better shape and get a fuck load of money because I'm better than at least 99 percent of people lol , fuck you 99% lol I kidding or maybe I'm not kidding lol
