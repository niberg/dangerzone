Running out of options

It's not so much that I want to die but I just don't wan't to live anymore. I was suspected of depression at a very young age (2nd grade) and for the most part I've never been very optimistic or happy with life. And as if the depression wasn't enough the anxiety had to come along and increase my problems tenfold. The anxiety alone makes me want to end it all. Constantly day in and day out dripping sweat as if I was in the middle of a work out. I can't even shake someones hand without seeing a disgusted look on their face from touching my cold clammy hands. Forget even getting close to a woman. Honestly I would try and seek professional help but I'm so broke I can't even afford to ride the bus since I wrecked my car. I can't continue with college and have been out of work and even when I was working I was barely scraping by. I live with my grandpa but when he passes (Which could be any day) I will be homeless and shit out of luck. I can't find the only gun in this house and definitely can't afford one. The next best thing is looking through the medicine cabinet but I need something that will work for sure. I've been looking for a couple of hours online for the best way for a painless suicide but all I could find was people saying not to do it and find someone to talk to. Well I don't have anyone to talk to so that led me here.

Sorry it's so long but it's my first time having to say/write this.
