I'm a piece of shit and it's nobody's fault but mine.

I can't better myself alone.

I've never had someone I can call a real friend. I have nobody. I'm fucking up in school because I'm lazy and can't concentrate no matter what I try. I'm in pain and angry all tge time. Derealization is the worst in years. People avoid me because I look ridiculously younger than I really am. I can't say a coherent sentence. Normal conversation is loud and annoying to me. I can't fulfill my dreams because of these things.
