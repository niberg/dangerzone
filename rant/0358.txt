This bubble town is swiftly collapsing into itself.

My brother received a mailing from our high-school alumni association several weeks ago. He graduated in June. Apparently, their core membership is dying off...and rightly so. Life is just too short to merit wanking over your two-minute stint on homecoming court or that *gee-whiz totally swell* time when you shoved that one geeky kid into his locker. I swear, Middle America seems like a strange alternate dimension sometimes.
