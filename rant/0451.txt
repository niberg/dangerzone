I don't get it

I don't understand anything. After two years we decide it isn't working at a distance,  and after being so in love she's with someone else so soon, and two more years you apologize, and I'm such a lame ass that I think I have a shot of having you love me again. It only took about a week to admit to each other that we still love each other, you told me how I'm the only one you trust and you made me pour my heart out to you and admit that I thought of you every single day for two years even after you were gone. You tell me he's mean and ask me if it's weird you still talk to me and break me. And now all I want to do is make you laugh like we always do and you just shut me down out of nowhere. I don't understand,  do you really love me? What is gonna happen? I hope it gets explained soon. Step on me again or help me back up please, I'm too broken to try anything and I'm mot brave enough to look for something new. I'm too old to start looking again, I feel like I'll never love again if I don't get to love you.
