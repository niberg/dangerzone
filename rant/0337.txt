Doctor Who has the most stupid fandom ever

I'm a Doctor Who fan, but every time I see reactions to new episodes, it's always about how Steven Moffatt is ruining the series, how the latest episode has "ruined the show" for them (the commenter), and other stupid stuff.

I count myself apart of many fandoms, from Buffy, Firefly, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Star Trek, Twilight, South Park, Bob's Burgers, It's Always Sunny, Marvel, DC, and yes, Doctor Who, but I'm sick of "fans" who do nothing but insult the people who make the show and constantly belittle the show they're supposedly "fans" of. 

And before people jump in and say "But fans don't need to like every episode", no they don't. But it's like the fandom is sprinkled with people whose sole purpose is to just troll and whinge every time someone posts something about Doctor Who. It's shitting me to tears.

I thought fans were supposed to be civil, mature and supportive, not hate-filled, vitriolic, entitled cretins.
