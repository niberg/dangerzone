I've got the wonderful experience of going to my girlfriends family reunion.

Currently, her parents had to move back in with her because they have no grasp on financial matters, and can barely provide for themselves.  There is no food because they eat everything, and don't even think to restock after it is gone. (I love my food). They use all of her things, her car, her food, her space, her power and sewage, her own bedroom (she is sleeping on the couch).  They will never pay any of this back and she has spent thousands of dollars on them they will never be grateful for or repay.  And with the reunion coming up, everyone is just more stressed.  But the good news in all this is they will be moving out soon!  It is set I stone and there are legal repercussions for violating their agreement.  By far the best news of the week so, for anyone who reads this thanks for listening, I just need to get that off my chest.
