My store manager is a moron.

I need to get this off my chest before my job dehumanises me any more.

I work in retail as a member of  management, where my role involves staffing a certain section of our business. We have a set number of full timers, but need extras on certain days where we feel the extra help would be more profitable (,I don't really want to give away too much. Never know who reads these).

So everyday I update this piece of crap rota and save it on our network so everyone can access it as and when.

Roll on the management meeting, store manager's turn to speak. I'll call them Paperweight since no one's really sure what this person offers, let alone achieves.

Paperweight "So I've got a list of actions I want everyone to complete." (Hands out action list)

Xaddiv "Oh that's interesting. I seem to be on most of these..."

Paperweight "Is there anything on there anyone is unhappy with?"

Xaddiv "Yes, what is it you actually want here? It says you want an update on cover for 10 weeks in advance. Do you just need me to show you where the rota is?"

Paperweight "I know where it is."

Xaddiv - perplexed look... "So even though you have access to it, you still want me to show you it every week, even though when there is an issue, I come tell you anyway?"

Paperweight "Yes"

I'm clearly missing a point here. I mean Paperweight has access to check up on the rota off their own back with out needing me to babysit them through it. I even document when someone cancels.

This isn't the first time either. A couple of managers meetings before that, Paperweight asked me to give them a report each week with a particular KPI. We get data sent in by an external company on this KPI, which yet again, is accessible by everyone on site.

Why am I being asked to waste my time just because paperweight is an idle fuckwit? :(
