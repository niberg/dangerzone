Identity Theft

Last year I was tired and ordered a TRX system online at a website. I didn't pay attention since I compared like 10 websites and went with the cheapest one that seemed legit. Well, turned out to be a website selling Chinese knock offs. I fought with them and managed to get paypal to refund my money and I didn't have to return the item thankfully since they wanted me to ship it to China. I didn't use the fake one since I don't really want to have the straps snap and I fall and break my nose. 


Well, apparently I still paid a price since now they are using my data to register fake websites to scam people. Great. I just received a letter from WIPO that lists my information slightly incorrect along with about 12 other people who probably fell for the same crap that I did. 


The fake TRX website is still up and the email address is the same for all the defendants in this case including the original fake website that I ordered my crap off of on the whois page. I contacted the WIPO and hopefully they will read what I write since I was just stupid and didn't pay attention to the type of site I was ordering from.
