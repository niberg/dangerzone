Lies!

I liked this one girl at my school. I was just going to ask her out in a couple of days, when my friend walks up to me. 

"Hey, what do you think about [Insert name of the girl I like]?"

"She's nice," I reply, not wanting to betray my emotions for her.

"Really? I think she's kind of an ass!" My friend says.

"I don't think that's right," I say, and then the conversation ends.

A couple days later, when I've finally worked up the nerve to try and ask her out, I see her and my friend holding hands. 

Wtf, right?

I probably should have been more forward, but he shouldn't have just lied outright.
