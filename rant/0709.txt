Why is it so hard for you to cut your bread all the way through?

I can't even count the number of restaurants I go to where they serve bread before the meal, and the bread is sliced about 2/3 of the way through the loaf. WHY? whose fucking idiotic idea was this?  Did someone think a bunch of people sitting at a table that wanted to eat bread would enjoy mangling the loaf with their bare hands while trying to tear a piece of bread off? Did they think we would not enjoy a loaf we could simply grab a piece of bread already fully sliced? Like, I wouldn't enjoy my bread unless I had to really work for it?

Restaurants - cut your fucking bread all the goddamn way through the loaf. I don't want someone else's grubby paws mauling a loaf of bread to remove a piece.
