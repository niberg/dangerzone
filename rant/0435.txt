Fuck my broke ass school. (Long and thrown together)

Jesus fuck, we've had 5 projectors stolen this month. PROJECTORS. Who steals those? Now my teacher has to buy one herself for her room and with the salary they make (one of the lowest in the country mind you) thats gonna seriously put her back.
Why cant we get more funding for sports, or renovate our gym, or get us new textbooks like that supposedly bajillion dollar grant to our school system was intended for?

If we cant afford new textbooks, can we PLEASE clean or renovate those filthy fucking bathrooms? i feel like im gonna get AIDS walking in there. What the fuck is the point of having shower stalls if you're not gonna maintenence them? Theres mold and mildew on the fucking floor. The handles are rusted still anyway. Not many people take showers after gym but what if someone does? I know its mainly those dirty ass kids why the bathrooms are filthy, but if the custodians could clean in there more than once a month thatd be fantastic.

The worst part is many of the teachers deserve much better than the shitty treatment from students, the shittier treatment from administration and the bum ass salary they get for educating the people that will grow up to run this country. Some of these teachers are extremely overqualified, my 4th period teacher has a phd in something that isn't coming to me right now, has multiple awards and yet he teaches at this shitty school?

Now im aware public education isnt available everywhere and im especially thankful for the education I recieve. I just don't think its fair that there are schools in the same district as me that have top educational supplies, top teachers and then theres us. Some broke bum ass west side school, and i cant even go anywhere else because of zoning.

To my ex-principal that put us thousands of dollars into debt: Fuck you and your shitty administration, fuck everything you did(n't do) for this dirty whorehouse of a school.
