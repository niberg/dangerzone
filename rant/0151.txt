Damn I'm sick of these Longhorn Steakhouse commercials...

I'm not going to a steakhouse just to settle for ribs (though they still look awesome), I'm getting the good shit. Filet and lobster is the only way to go. But guess what, I just lost my fucking job so I can't afford that shit. Tender, perfectly aged filet, paired with lobster that's perfectly cooked (unlike the other place that has "lobster" in the fucking name) with real fucking butter. I gotta see those commercials like every 5 minutes? Just fuck you guys.
