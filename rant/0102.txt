Two Broke Girls got it wrong.

The show tonight had a 9 year old gay kid in it and he was equipped with a lisp, finger snap, lexicon and rainbow fabulous bed room.

Seems like stereotypes and generalizations are something that plague the gay community. Why perpetuate it on television? 

A person can't just be gay without being big, bright and shiny.
