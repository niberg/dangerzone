Fat is not a body type!

Recently we've all heard more than we cared for about SJWs, these idiotic morons that not only think being "fridgekin" or "asexual genderfluid whattheshit" is  acceptable, but also that whoever doesen't accept their way of thinking is white male cis-scum.


But that, I can tolerate. You feel different, and it's not your fault. You act bitchy about it, but you will grow, or life will slap you in the face. You'll still be weird, but also wise.

However, I recently found out about these "fat supporting" SJWs, and all their delusional BS, and they made me fucking snap.
People claiming (falsely) that they actually excercise and eat healthy, and that it's all hormone's fault thet they are the fat slobs the are.
This I can't accept. I used to be a fat slob. I used to be 220 lbs for 5'9. I started getting up early in the morning and running, and eathing like a sane person, and caring about my health. I am now  normal.
I'd like you to focus on what I said. I was fat. I did stuff. I am now normal. What does this mean?
You can't stop being gay. You can't stop feeling like you are "otherkin", if you really feel it (I guess).You obviousely can't stop being black. ***But you can stop being fat.*** Just go for a run and stop drinking soda everyday.
I'll tell you more: I eat like a motherfucker. I eat a lot of pasta and pizza. I eat cookies all the bloody time. But I do boxing 3 times a week and lift on tuesdays and thursdays. I burn the fucking calories.


So, No. I'm not respecting you because you are fat. You are an idiot. You are an expense for society. You will fucking have heart attacks and my taxes are going to pay the doc that saves your unworthy ass.
You need assistance for everything. You are nothing more than a manchild.
At least don't act like you deserve anything more than a punch in the face.


***Disclaimer: I'm cool with gays, really. Also with blacks and transgender and shit. I don't like SJWs, but I'm not a fascist.***
