Vanity sizing

Seriously. Fuck vanity sizing. I took my sister shopping for new clothes today (it was her birthday) and I swear to god this made what should have been a 2-3 hour trip take fucking forever. She is a very small person (size 6, normally). It took a while to figure out why she was practically drowning in size 6, and we had to keep on going down one size at a time until we found the right size. Vanity sizing serves no goddamn purpose. If you want to feel like a size 6 when you should be a size 12 or 14 or whatever then take some goddamn responsibility. No one else should have to suffer because you want to feel thin without putting in the effort to get in shape. It's a huge inconvenience and it's pissing me off. And before I get any crap about diet and exercise being "hard" or whatever, no one said it was easy. Just take some fucking responsibility and stop inconveniencing others for your own feelz.
