Why the fuck are you [facebook friends] so stupid. (politics rant)

I have two gay friends from university (im gay as well if that matters but i dont think it does) on facebook complaining that our home state went to democrats but cheering that national politics is in their favor. You both are voting for people who are against gays and against providing equal rights for civil partnerships, employment protection, and just dont care about who you are. I get that you care about economic issues, but i just cant comprehend why you would vote for a republican over a third party. Then for one of you, the fact that you're a failed history teaching major turned history major and failing at that so your job prospects will suck. Then you also want to be a homeopathic store owner while being a dad to a kid you had in highschool. I dont understand why you would be for the republicans who want to remove all the support you would get for your kid and unemployment. Or for someone who loves the earth, you're for the party that wants to remove the EPA and destroy the earth. You two dont fucking make sense to me.
