Tomorrow comes today

I'm burning out.

Current 3rd year university mathematics honours student working to ensure I don't die.

Every damn week:
Monday-Wednesday: wake up, class. Cram as many assignments into the evening as possible so that I can make deadlines. 
Thursday-Friday: lectures, work until 9pm. Finish various assignments.
Sat-Sun: work both mornings. Study for various quizzes, tests.
Monday: ...

Have been doing this shit for a year and a half. You may think: ' hey, at least you have a nice, long summer break!' But fucking no, full time work to pay tuition, while evenings are spent studying for professional exams so I can maybe get employed.

Holy fuck, when will I see a break?
