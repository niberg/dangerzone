A good realization

I remember now why i spend so much time alone wasting my time on the internet. It is not an entirely bad situation, i got to remember much that i forgot. Im happy alone. 

Not  having work means i spend a lot of time gaming, redditing and watching anime. I started to plan on working out, getting an apartment and studying so i can get to meet people and feel happy about myself. Fuck people. I feel more lonely with people then i could ever feel with me and a bag of crisps. Its ok to not interact with people, i don't have to be reminded that people ultimately don't care about me. Well, they sort of do. 

They invite me places because they used to know me, they make me boost their ego. They never care about what i think of anything. Its just me trying to care about what other people do. And a lot of times i do end up caring about what they think. But it is never reciprocated. 

I hate how when it comes to any social situation, hobbies, world view etc. i always have to be the one to bend.

And when it comes to any group situation, even if it is three people, i just feel left out. And when i try to call out on it people just say im whiny. Easy for them to say. It is as if everyone walks around and get some special acknowledgement i don't get. As if their charisma is stats from a game and not portrayed in actual body language and intellect. I don't have autism, but everyone else magically cares about everyone else more. 

I can be smart, funny and a good friend. If not everyone pushed me away or ignored me. And at the same time i only think people invite me because they know my face and name. But they could not give a shit to know me, even through all these years.
