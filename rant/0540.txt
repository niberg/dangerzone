Shutup

Few things piss me off more than someone telling me what to do. Yes I do have a rebellious streak. I'm not going to blindly obey you. I'm an adult and we don't share the same values. I don't care if you think its disrespectful for me to curse in front of you. I will continue to do so at my own discretion. I don't curse in front of children, in the general public, nor at work or school. I curse with those I'm familiar around which is generally my family. These people have known me for years and know that it's how I choose to express myself. I speak my mind as I see fit. I will laugh at your values if I find them unreasonable, repugnant, and ridiculous. I'm not going to stifle my laughter, I never can anyway. I'm a blunt individual and I'm not going to play by your rules. These same people are hypocritical. You can't tell me not to curse and yet you go around and do the same thing. I find your existence on this planet disrespectful. I'm not trying to impress you? Who the fuck are you? Nobody. Your my mother's boyfriend. You say I disrespect her by cursing in front of her, yet you steal her money. Fuck off, loser.
