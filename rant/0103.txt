Being 50-something doesn't give you the right to be condescending

I spend HOURS every fucking day reading all sorts of shit on international events for speech competitions, for my second-year IR class, and because it's what I want to fucking do for a living. How DARE you tell me I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, rolling your eyes because we're all just a bunch of "kids" you ageist piece of shit. I fucking guarantee you the group of us "kids" could collectively take on leading IR theorists, if not solely for the fact that there's about 40 of us who each at least know something really well. We have in depth conversations on Venezuelan economic trends and the effect on the global economy, using enough IR and economic jargon that it becomes hard for a lot of people to understand. I'm not under any impression that this knowledge makes us better than anyone else. We chose something to focus on like everyone does, but don't fucking tell me we don't know our shit. Or that we couldn't possibly understand the conflicts in the Middle East. It's ALL WE FUCKING TALK ABOUT you condescending, smug waste of human space. 
 Oh, you have a link from the Daily Show, really?! But we're a bunch of "pretentious little brats with no concept of how world events really play out"?! Go fuck yourself.
