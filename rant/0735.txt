The USA has the best spy agency in the world, infrastructure which dwarfs that of others, an ungodly amount of information about their citizens... And yet they can't locate 132 plane passengers who could possibly have been infected with Ebola within 24 hours...

I would expect individual CDC teams or similar to descend on each and every passenger and crew of that domestic flight which contained an Ebola victim within hours of it being announced.
