What is the point again?

I am supposed to be reading two articles for microbiology tomorrow.  My two lab partners (Captain Incompetent and Dr. Dunce-head) and I have to present an origin theory of HIV.

The catch?  No two groups were allowed to select the same theory, which makes sense, however, my group got stuck with the theory that the US government developed HIV while trying to produce a hepatitis B vaccine &lt;snort&gt;  How does this help anyone learn anything about microbiology?

On top of this, because we are a three person group, we each have to present an aspect of the theory... 1:  Overview of the theory (brought to you by Captain Incompetent)  2:  The argument for the theory (presented by moi)  3:  The argument against the theory (presented by Dr. Dunce-head... seriously, I had to explain to this dude 3-4 times these three options and ask him which one he preferred...)

I need to mention this theory has already been debunked a thousand times and is no longer even remotely considered valid, yet I get to defend it.

I'm going to make an elaborate tin-foil hat to wear throughout my presentation and drink copious amounts of alcohol tonight, and quickly read the two articles in the morning.  Because, I officially state:  Fuck this shit.
