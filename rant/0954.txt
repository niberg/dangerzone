End discrimination against people who have a feliny that is more than 10 years old.

When I was 18 I got a felony, I was young and I was doing something dumb, I stole a computer and got caught for it. I haven't had any police involvement since then but I still can't find a decent job. I think they should pass a law to end the discrimination against felons that have been "good" for 10+ years. I am now 30 years old and I am finding it very hard to provide for my family because of something that I regret that I did 12 years ago.
