SUE REDBULL

i tell ya guys i'm not gonna "sue" redbull for a free 12-pack or whatever. i buy their shit all the time. why? because i fucking love that company. i love everything they do. i believe in them. drinks for a pick-me-up, videos to get pumped up.

red bull sponsors so much rad shit, the last thing i want is for them to have a smaller budget to do insane sports/stunts.

for real them dumbshit sue happy bitches never once cried over not literally growing wings.
