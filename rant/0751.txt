Work.

What I do for a living has its high and low points. The work I do is decent. I run into problems, things don't the way it should, whatever. But it's the people that usually cause the low points.

People borrow things from me then return it damaged saying,"ohh you should buy better quality shit so this doesn't happen." Oh yeah?

Or, " Is your shit broken?" Dude, they break it and make it my own fault it happened. You know what their excuse is? " I helped you out so we're even." That's a great trade off. Better yet, they return it damaged and not even tell me. Then act like nothings wrong, reassuring themselves that it wasn't their fault to begin with.

Fuck me for spending money for shit I need.

I get blamed for being slow. Which is funny cause I have some shit luck. If, what appears to be a simple job comes in, I have to waste my time dealing with the shit the last guy fucked up, or what the customer has done. 

The manager comes in, " It's a fifteen minute job, what the fucks taking so long?!?!" 

My rebuttal, " Oh I don't know, this plastic piece of shit is welded to that fuckin wire. &lt;&lt;*( Real story) And everything else is warped on."

Another thing, people I work with. They just keep saying shit to me. It's one thing to bust my balls, but when you keep going at it and you keep saying the same shit over and over, it kind of gets old.

I don't stand up for my self. What's the point? If I speak up for myself, then I'm a problem. All I can do is bite my tongue. They say i'm a good guy. For what? Not saying anything back at them?

Get this, the same people that keep fucking with me, wants me to help them. I can't make money doing their jobs, and they know that. I'm wasting my time helping them out and I'm not sure there's anything I can do about it.
