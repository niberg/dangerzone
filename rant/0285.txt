Jesus Christ, how fucking hard is it to make a fucking cup of coffee.

So my family and I were on a road trip. We stop at a Wendy's along the way for some lunch, and I order a coffee with my food. The lady behind the counter is like "I don't really know how to make coffee, so I didn't put another pot on after this ran out" holy fuck, that's your job. So she says it'll be 10 minutes for the coffee. At this point I'm already pissed as all hell. Finally she calls me over to get my food and coffee, but some dude the size of a whale tries to cut infront and order and meal for 17 people apparently. (Actually order: 5 burgers with cheese and bacon, 7 fries, 4 5 piece nuggets, and a drink) I wasn't waiting 20 minutes for this asshole to get his last supper,  so I'm like "Bull-Hell you're ordering now bud" I cut back in front of him, and she hands me my bag of food and the coffee. I get back to the van, and take a sip of coffee. It was so fucking strong. It's like she used 5 scoops for every cup. I drank the whole thing, and ended up with a stomach ache to kill a horse. Did no one show here how to make fucking coffee?

TL:DR: Don't get coffee for a ditzy Wendy's employee.
