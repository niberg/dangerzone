SO's sister is cheap and it seems in the only one who notices.

Ok. My SO and SO's sister went to a movie tonight. The sister didn't arrive yet and it looked like the movie would sell out, so I got the tickets ahead of time.
The sister never gave me the money for her ticket. This is not the first time. This has happened like a half dozen times already. It's not like she's a kid. She's a fully grown adult with a computer science degree. She makes more money than I do. Why am I always paying for these things?
The sister lives with her parents, so her room and board is all provided for. I'm 100% independent, plus I make less money than she does, so why is there this expectation of me paying.
I don't know if I'm being a cheap asshole about this, or there's some custom I never picked up about paying for not only my SO, but also family members.
What say you?
