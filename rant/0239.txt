I have to pay $11.95 to access a CD key I've already paid for. Fuck you, OnTheHub.

Few weeks ago, I bought Office 365 for University. I bought it on a website called "OnTheHub", which I was directed to through my College.

University version of Office 365 is $80 for 4 years. Not cheap for an unemployed college student, but still a good deal compared to their non-student pricing.

Couple attempts were made to redeem the CD key on Microsoft's website. It wouldn't work. Spent a few days contacting Microsoft support multiple times, before finally being told to just phone in. I was pretty frustrated having gone around in circles with support, so I decided *fuck it, I'll fix this when I need Office*. Just my luck, I get an assignment this week that involves using Office.

Knowing that I now need Office, I go back to the OnTheHub site to check my key. That's where it was before, in the "My Account" page. Oh, but guess what? This motherfucking website OnTheHub wants me to pay $11.95 to access my CD key because apparently access to it has "expired". Are you fucking kidding me? I now have to pay twelve damn dollars to access something I've already paid for? I already fucking purchased this CD key, so *give me the motherfucking CD key*. It's a fucking string of text.

Yes. You know what? I *should* have just written it down. However, the fact that I could have avoided a twelve dollar fee by just writing down a string of fucking numbers and letters highlights how bullshit of a fucking fee this really is. You know who *doesn't* do this? Steam. Origin. Fucking *everybody ever*.

One thing I can tell you for sure: I am not going to fund bullshit. I am ***not*** paying $11.95 to access this fucking CD key. What I **am** going to do is pirate Office 2013. It's the closest thing I can get to Office 365, which I've already fucking paid for. I am also sure as fucking shit not using this OnTheHub site willingly *ever again*.

Ugh. I hope whoever implemented this fee finds this reddit post, prints it out, reads the first letter of each paragraph, and chokes on it while I punch them in the chest. Fuck whoever you are.
