Moved to Phoenix, AZ not as happy as I thought I'd be

I came to Phoenix AZ for a vacation a month and a half ago loved it. Moved out here been here for a couple weeks and I'm not really happy. Is it because I'm home sick or just haven't given it time? Got my job transferred out here and I hate working at the store down here in Phoenix I miss everyone and what I had back at home.
