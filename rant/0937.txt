Dress codes

It really bothers me when dress codes say girls should dress a certain way because if they reveal anything it would "distract the boys." Ok is it the girl's responsibility for the guy to have some decency? Girls are supposed to be perfect and polite to cater to the boys getting turned on? Why should the dress code revolve around guys who can't control themselves? If a girl wears some skinny jeans, that's what she likes. If a guy gets distracted, that's her problem for him not controlling himself? At least have some respect.
