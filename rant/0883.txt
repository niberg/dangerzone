My chemistry teacher sucks ass (university)

So she is a former high school teacher (figures) and my problem is that she sets up BlackBoard ( we interface for relative course) in a moronic way. She only posts her powerpoints which poorly explain the material, and she makes no reference to our text what so ever. Our text explains the material much better. I have to look through my e-text to find the material which is scattered and that alone takes quite a lot of time all because she does not tell us which chapters we are covering only which concepts. 

Apparently she thinks she can explain it better with her childish power-points that have a bunch of stupid cartoons,pictures, and her dull sense of humor that make me want to smash my fucking computer. She's also very rude otherwise I would probably shut up and deal with it. 

We also only get 60 mins for our tests (big lecture hall) and that's not enough time for most people. One test she said she was going to come in 30 mins early but she was running late so overall she only came 10 mins early -_- and she also makes us take these quizes on blackboard that she made herself , but the problem is the accuracy of the answers we submit because she does not explain well enough how we should input our answers so we can easily get them wrong if we miss something trivial like an extra space after our answer. Anyways, sorry for the disjointed rant it's very late and I am studying.
