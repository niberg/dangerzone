Never using PayPal again

I have used PayPal to buy things and send money.

Today I got an email from PayPal that I needed to make a payment on my account.  They had not billed my credit card with my last purchase, they put it on their credit service - I had no idea.  And now they won't let me pay it with my credit card, they insist I add a bank account or send a check.

I am going to send a check.  I consider this fraud on PayPal's part.  They are not accepting a credit card payment which is what I was using the service for.  And they want to charge me interest in 5 days if I don't pay.
