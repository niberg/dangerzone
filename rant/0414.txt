friggin walmart

went to walmart to buy a purse for general things, wasn't looking for name brands or anything. ...seen one I wanted. It had no price so I looked around for another so I could go to checkout  ( I hate shopping even tho I'm a girl) 
not only could they not give me a price they took it back and wouldn't  sell it to me. I was rotted and I really wanted it ( insert whine here)
