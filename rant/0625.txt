Why me!?!!! You mentally hurt me and keep hurting me so many times But No matter how bad i hurt i always want to see you and it hurts soooo good. I wish there was just a way where I could just push a button and the though of us and you would be gone.

But i cant do that, I am still in love with you!Since you are queer now i need to get it though my head that there wont be an "us" anymore anytime, i just cant give up. I want to fight for you but i feel like it is worthless to try and change your mind.
