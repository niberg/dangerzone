WOMEN SUCK!!!! (Is that ok here?)

I am just done with women. My ex is pissing me off. She is pursuing child support but will only let me see my child when its convenient for her or she wants to go out with her boy friend. I am scared to talk to her about having a schedule change that will impact when I am "supposed" to see her. ( state mins.) I am upset with my self because she has moved on and I am still picking up the pieces. Then there is a girl at work that is coming on WAY to hard. I met her once and within the first hour, she was at my house asking me what I wanted in a relationship and for my number. Iv tried to express that I am not attracted to her and she shuts down, and it gives me the feeling she is going to freak out. On top of that, I am having trouble in the dating world. I want to try online dating, but I hate how seedy and hookerish feeling it is. it bugs me. Im feeling angry, depressed, and not good enough. I feel like the only lady I dont hate is my mother, and who could hate their mother, right? Im just so sick of the shit. I try and try, and it seems like nothing I do its good enough and that no one sees me as worthy. I am just so mad!
