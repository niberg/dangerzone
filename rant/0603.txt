Next job I interview for I will ask about two things

1. Do I get a laptop...as opposed to a workstation?

2. What's your remote working policy?


I'm fed up with open plan offices, of people having meetings 10 feet from my desk, and execs bashing on those who complain about the noise...claiming we're not "collaborative" or "team players".

Excuse me if I need peace and quiet to do the work you pay me for.
