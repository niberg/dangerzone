wasted my time this morning seeing a physical therapist who gave me stupid information

I went to see a physical therapist (PT) this morning after seeing my primary physician because of pain near my hip flexor. This PT gave me the most uninformed, useless information! 

She pretty much said that I should stop squatting below parallel because it's pinching the muscles in my hips. I told her that trainers and bodybuilders squat below parallel. She said that didn't matter, and made the stupidest analogy. "You don't smoke at age 15 and you don't get lung cancer. Doesn't mean it's not bad for you."

She asked what other leg exercises I do, and I mentioned deadlifts. She told me to stop performing deadlifts because "it's bad for your back" while demonstrating what she _thinks_ is a deadlift, with her back rounded. 

I just lost it right there. All those letters on her business card (PT, DPT, OCS) are not going to give her any credibility.
