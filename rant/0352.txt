Can't get away from commercialized holidays on the Internet

Even major scientific channels are tainted with useless videos:

* NASA: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9x7TYcxBU

* CERN: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqOWMmg_fHA

* TRI: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFjMznLb9y8


I'M SO SICK OF IT.
