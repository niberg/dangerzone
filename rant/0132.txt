"You've been excited to play this new game for a month, but don't have a console? I'm gonna use this to have a power trip!"

A few months ago, I noticed that there was a cool game gonna come out ([subreddit](/r/the_crew)). There was no beta to sign up for, so I just decided to wait until closer to release (December 2). About 3 weeks ago, I saw that there was a new beta about to open for Xbox One and PS4. Guess what I don't have? Either of those. So, I asked my friend to sign up for it since he could actually play it. He said he might. I convinced him to do it (after a week or so of begging). He says he'll do it that weekend. Saturday comes, I ask if he has it yet. He says he doesn't know. I ask him to check. He says later. Later comes, he ignores me. Today I ask again, and he says he doesn't know. I ask if he told it to download or not. He says maybe, and that the more I ask, the longer he's gonna make me wait. Now he says he's only doing this because I asked him a million times over a month (wasn't a month). This is the same guy that whines incessantly when we play other games, frequently ragequits, then whines more about it while on the way to/from school.
