Why do airport bathrooms still have stalls that open in?

I got a god damn carry-on, briefcase, and to get myself and luggage in to the stall I have to squash up against the toilet with my legs and suitcase, sometimes standing on the toilet, getting that 'bola all over me and my stuff. Novel idea here fucktards have the stall door swing out. Also not to mention, some stalls the carry-on won't even fit. What kind of idiot builds a stall in an airport bathroom that won't fit the luggage. How am I supposed to keep an eye on my bags and pee?
Oh and while we're at it all bathroom doors need to be push to exit. So after I wash my hands and the bathroom only has those disgusting hand dryers that disperse all sorts of germs into the air, I can use my foot to open the door and not touch the same 'bola ridden handle as all the nasty people who didn't wash their hands touched.  
Don't tell me I am the only one who has thought this?
