I'm Only Out For Myself? Screw you.

I let you live in my house rent free. You've never had to chip in on bills. You're supposed to but I don't push it because you're not employed. Nope. Two and half years and counting and you're just sitting around letting me support you and your kid. And now that the money has dried up, you're panicking and just now getting around to wondering how you're going to live. And you want me to sell *my* house. Yeah, I'll just find an apartment and move from the place I own outright and throw money down the toilet renting because you have bled me dry doing absolutely nothing and you want to have the cash to do nothing some more. For once, I am not willing to sacrifice and be inconvenienced in order to put you and your responsibilities and wants ahead of myself or mine. And you think I'm only out for myself. Believe it or not, I am not obligated to make sure you are taken care of.
