Pretty trivial compared to a lot of the things on here, but it irks me.

If I have one of those cubical things with little dots on it that you roll in games of chance, that's called a die. If I have more than one, what I have are called dice. The one with more letters means more of the thing. It's not really that hard, but so many people get it wrong!
