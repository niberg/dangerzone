Never in my life have I seen such a pathetic person.

WHY ARE YOU STILL WITH HER? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? You're both my friends but I can't watch her treat you like dirt anymore. It's borderline abusive. The shit that she says to you is insane. And yet you smile and take it any way. I remember one time you sitting next to me and whispering, "Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like with out Ellie in it." I wanted to hug you. I wanted to tell you that you're strong enough to end it with her. That you don't need the way she treats you in your life. You're a human fucking being. You are not her slave yet you let her treat you like one. I hate coming home from college and hanging out with you guys because of it. You're so much better than the way she treats you. And I know you'll end up marrying her because you think she's the best you could ever have. I think I've changed my mind actually. This constitutes as abuse. Because looking back on it I've seen her physically hurt you and I know that the mental abuse is there. Right now you guys are in the bathroom and I can hear her being mean to you. Sarcasm, talking down to you, dirty looks. She calls you stupid which I know isn't true. You're infinitely smarter than her. I just wish that you'd see that you can do better than her. That there are a million and five people out there that will love you more than she ever could. I want you to have the relationship that I have with my boyfriend because I know you'd be happier. Yet you take this abuse. And there's nothing I can do.
