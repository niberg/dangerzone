Cards Against Humanity is Fucking Stupid

   The whole point of the game is to be more edgy than your opponents, and the main problems lie in the fact that using forced humor is essential to the game. Unlike Apples to Apples, where the answer doesn't have to be funny, you lose horrifically if it isn't comedy gold.
   But considering that you aren't crafting jokes yourself, and are just making a shit collage of different offensive things, even the best results really fucking suck, and they're drowned out by the fact you had to hear 4 or 5 ones that were triple shitty.

"What are my parents hiding from me?"
"The winner is... JERKING OFF INTO A POOL OF CHILDREN'S TEARS!!"

   THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE FUCKING SENSE! HOW IS THIS ANY BETTER THAN TEH PENGU1N OF D00M!? And it breaks my little heart to know this game is teaching people that this kind of humor is ok. Not the fact that it's controversial humor, but the thought that it makes people think they can just be like "DEAD BABIES RAPED BY PASTORS WITH AIDS" and everyone will just die with laughter. This game follows me like the plague. Every once in a while at a social gathering, someone will pull the game out. Everyone gets excited and starts playing but by the end of it everyone regrets sifting through 100 or so really unfunny combinations to listen to maybe 25 decent ones. If you want to expose your self to decent comedy, experience NEW THINGS and not the same deck of cards every weekend of your freaking life.
