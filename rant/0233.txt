Nobody likes a Dolores Umbridge!

Your mannerisms, the way you treat others, every little non-physical detail is just like Dolores Jane Umbridge (with a lowered voice). You're supposed to be an private educator for those at a collegiate level, despite not being a professor, yet you do nothing but belittle those around you, acting like you know everything and treating others like idiots and children, and make them want to quit. Even your compliments are bittersweet- sweet at first when you hear it as a compliment, then realize you just insulted them with a compliment. The only people that like you are those just like you, and everyone else- including professors and doctors- truly hates you. Whenever you walk into the room, typically uninvited, the atmosphere changes and yet you don't either pick up or care about the cold shoulder. Every word out of your mouth makes everyone cringe and hate you more; your mouth is simply another exit sphincter for your shit. Take your "compliments" and the bullshit advice you shove down everyone's asses and shove them up your own. I feel sorry for those who are still forced to have you as a private educator.
