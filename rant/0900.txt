Headphones in my ears = I CAN'T HEAR YOU

Seriously, you see these two wires going in my ears? They're called headphones, and they are playing music. Which means when you come up to me and start talking, all I see is a moving mouth.

OK great, you tap me on the shoulder to get my attention. But then you start talking AS I'M STILL REMOVING MY HEADPHONES. You can see, right? You can see that I'm still sitting up and am actually in the act of removing them?

And if you try and call me and I can't hear you, you don't fucking keep calling me louder and louder. And when you do finally get my attention after multiple tries, don't look around and laugh like I was fucking daydreaming about fairies and couldn't hear you saying my name.
