Windows 8.1, what the actual hell is this sh*t?

This is beyond annoying. Holy crap Microsoft. Not only was it extremely hard to not take this stupid ass update as long as possible when it was in an "early but obviously extremely stable" state that crashed every pc on installation or program use, but it would also, up to this day, make me lose an osu beatmap or league of legends fight at least once a day because "HEY, WIN 8.1 HERE, PLS". 

Now today, it did something new. It didn't give me the "Fuck you, go away" option anymore. It was just "either do it now or in 4 hours". So that's where I thought it was the point to finally get done with this shit hoping that they have since the release increased the stability of this pile of dumb software.

So, I started the installation. Everything was so beautiful. Until the installation got stuck. Wouldn't move anymore for several hours. So I did what every user would do at that point - restart.

But of course, the installation wasn't finished. So windows got confused, and tried to reset my windows to an older installation - which took another 30 minutes or so. I thought "Alright, I'm just gonna let this finish and then install Windows 8.1 while I'm asleep"

But oh no, godfather windows has other plans. Because even though half of the official windows website is telling me that WINDOWS 8.1 IS THE MOST AWESOME THING SINCE SLICED BREAD, I can't actually INSTALL it! As soon as I go into the web store, and want to apply the update, it tells me - "Yeah, yeah. We downloaded the thing. You will automatically be asked to upgrade to win 8.1....eventually"

So now I'm sitting here, waiting for that pop-up that I've been trying to ignore for 5 or so months straight because windows couldn't simply put an "install now" button into this damn thing.

Like, was this update specifically designed to annoy everyone who doesn't always want the LATEST AWESOME SHIT THAT BLUESCREENS YOUR ENTIRE PC?

God I hate this OS sometimes.
Give me SteamOS.
