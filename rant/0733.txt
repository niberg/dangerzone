Enough with the hyped up hysteria.

Just for fun I switched between FOX, CNN and MSNBC.  I'm not making this up, it took less than five seconds on each channel to hear "EBOLA".  Sure its a bad thing and I feel sorry for anyone who gets it, but seriously, this is just the media over-hyping something just like SARS, bird flu and killer bees.   So far, none of the people who were in close contact with the original victim contracted the disease, just his healthcare workers who had to touch him and his bodily fluids.   Just two out of 315,000,000 have gotten the disease, that means you have three times better of a chance at winning the Mega Millions Lotto than getting Ebola.  In the past 10 years, an average of 32,000 people a year die from the flu, that is much worse of a problem.
