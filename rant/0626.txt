Fuck you imperial system

Needed to know the density of a gold ball. Googl-ed it in english, as it always gives more results than my native language.

&gt; the nominal density of a golf ball is calculated to be approximately 0.65 ounces per cubic inch

Who the fuck uses "ounces per cubic inch" for density. Who the hell even need a unit for density ?! 
I hate you america (and you too, other countries using it).
