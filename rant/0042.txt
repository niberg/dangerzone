I think I might be a bad person

I was going to write an entire thesis angrily describing what has made my life so chaotic recently, but I do want to anymore. 

I currently have no true friends. I mean the ones that you could call and talk with them about stuff like this to. I used to. I don't know what happened. I've tried to plan things, but everyone is always busy. (For the record I am not complaining about my friends or those around me.) So here I am. I currently am in a relationship, but my last relationship (only ended two years ago) was ended horribly by myself when 7 months when I decided that my ex wasn't attractive enough, and I didn't want her to meet my friends. I am a fucking piece of shit. 

Anyways, my ex was a fantastic person, but I don't want to get into that. I heard that writing about someone makes it harder to get over them. I have gotten over the love aspect, just not the guilt one. Anyways, I'm lost now. I just feel hollow. It's not just the relationship. I can already feel myself becoming uninterested in my current relationship. 

I'm sorry. I'm being melodramatic. I am just pissed at myself for fucking up the great thing we had, for not appreciating the great thing that the relationship is, for not keeping in touch with my previously best friends, befriending those who only cared about appearances, for being an absolutely shitty child to my parents after I left, for being so flustered with all of it. It'd be nice if the world just stopped for a second. 

Fuck. I have fucked up. I just am not sure what to do. I think I am a bad person. But I have no idea how to change that. 

Anyways, thank you for reading this. I just needed to get it out.
