When people see my new phone....

I'm so god damn sick of having to explain this wherever somebody sees my new phone....

NO! ITS AN IPHONE 6PLUS, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT FOR GODS SAKE!

AND NO IT HASNT FUCKING BENT IN MY POCKET. STOP ASKING IF IT HAS BENT 

Seriously everyone says the same bloody thing whenever they see me with this
'Wow is that the new iPhone 6?'
*responds*
'Has it bent yet?'

Everywhere I go I have the same conversation and it drives me insane! Urgh....
