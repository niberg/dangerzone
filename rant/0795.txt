My asshole neighbor got all of my cats sick.

I had a new kitten that I spontaneously adopted from craigslist, the ad said he was found on the street and almost hit by a car. I had him for a week and was going to take him to the vet THAT weekend for vaccinations. My neighbor hates animals and called animal control on my other neighbors dog, because the dog liked to crap by his house (but the owner of the dog always cleaned it up). Well, animal control set up a trap with food in it, LESS THAN 10 feet from my house. Needless to say my kitty walked over there to eat the food, and the guy caught him and took him to an animal shelter. When I went to pick my cat up, he had green mucus oozing from his eyes, and I knew right then that he'd caught something from the other cats there. Well, I have two other cats who WERE vaccinated once long ago, but they've still somehow gotten sick from him. I believe it's either feline herpes virus or calcivirus. They all start out with mucus in their eyes and a bad wheeze/cough. I am so pissed. I love my cats like children (I'm a confirmed crazy cat lady) and it's all because an old mean man didn't like my other neighbors dog, and so my cats paid the price for it. He's a very shitty person, he's called the cops on people who were parked in front of his yard while they were moving in, they had no other place they could temporarily park and he called the police! The police station themselves know him to be a crazy asshole. Some old fucking farts just need to do us all a favor and die!
