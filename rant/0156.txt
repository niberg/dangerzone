"Eat Like a Lady"

Whoever says that or believes that is bullshitting themselves and everyone around them. There is no such thing as eating like a goddamn lady. It doesn't what the fuck between your damn legs everyone should act like a fucking decent human being with at some damn manners. 

No one wants you to hear you eat your damn food. It ain't a man thing, or women thing but a civilized human thing. So just cuz I'm female it makes it less unacceptable? Even men don't want that shit. If you want to do that shit in your home go ahead. But with people act like you know how to eat your food. It is fucking disgusting. It makes you look like a hungry hungry hippo.
