DON'T TURN INTO MY LANE

It happens way too often to be just a coincidence. A lot of people really never learned how to turn or were taught incorrectly. 

It happened twice this morning on my commute and happens pretty often. I'm driving along, minding my own business when I see a car up ahead. He has his turn signal on, intending to travel the same direction as I am going. Now, one of two things are bound to happen:

A) If he turns now, he will have enough time to speed up and not impede anyone. BUT NO, HE WAITS 10 MORE SECONDS BEFORE HE TURNS, NOT EVEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE. The rest of us have to brake sharply, maybe even swerve into another lane to avoid an accident- but that creates possibility for other accidents, because not everyone is paying attention, and the dipshit who turned has no idea of the danger he put us all in. 

B) Lets say there are 3 lanes of traffic. I am in a lane, a fair distance ahead of the cars in the other 2 lanes, so there is enough space to turn in front of *them*, not me- surely this guy realizes that, right? WRONG. INSTEAD OF TURNING INTO EITHER OF THE LANES I'M NOT IN, HE CUTS IN FRONT OF ME, TRAVELLING 30 MPH LESS THAN I AM. WHAT THE HELL?? Luckily, I can pass him on the side safely but I shouldn't have had to do so in the first place. I glare at him as I pass, but he's too stuck in his own little world to notice, and I get even more pissed off that I couldn't make him feel like shit for what he did. 

Seriously, I don't know why this happens to me as often as it does. I wish it were mario kart so that I could shoot shells at these shitty turners and teach them a lesson.
