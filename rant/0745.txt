Who the fuck calls a huge all in with pocket deuces?

I hate you with every fiber of my being. I wish renal cancer on you and herpes on your children. I pray to Dog Almighty that your wife catches the clap and passes it to your brother. I hope your cat gets hit by a car. I hope your dog eats a box of brownie mix and dies while vomiting on your bed pillows. I hope your home gets no knock warrant raided by a SWAT team with the wrong address and they throw a flash bang in your baby's crib. I hope the nurse that treats your sick family is one of those Texas Ebola nurses.
