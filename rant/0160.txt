Ex-Roommates breaking in, hurting my dogs, Police say they can legally do so

Nothing worse than being told you'll be charged if you don't let them in.        

Landlords forgot to evict previous tenets,  and now they apparently have a right to the home. They've broken property getting in (I have it on security camera) they steal my stuff, and worst of all -     

He takes his anger out on my dogs. A full 10 seconds of repeated kicks to the side before I see and chase him, but Police respond and not only tell me I can't charge them as they live there (guess animal abuse is allowed then) and have a right to the property.         

I've got a 4 year old Australian Cattle Dog that can hardly stand up for the last day although the vet says he's okay, just bruised.           

Best part - I've called the police each time they break in. The last time I get a call from the sergeant to not call 911 over this again.             

I know the guys names, ~~their new address~~ address is fake, just apparently cannot pursue this in a legal sense.

Colorado Springs - Homeless/Squatters have more rights than paying tenants, and can even perform acts of theft and animal abuse on the property and it's 100% legal.               

If I catch him kicking my dog again I'll do something about it. I don't care if its legal to hurt an animal like that, it's not going to happen on my property in front of me to **my** dog.
