Why do you shun me?

I pick up the the things they drop, I hold the door, I use good manners, and I crack jokes. Why do they hate me so?
Never have I offended or harmed them in any way,
Yet they look at me like I am a fool, they take advantage of my benevolence, they mock me. Why do they do this?
I draw them pictures, but they look at it like it's a pentagram, I create my very own alphabet, and they tell me "get some Jesus in your life" as if I am a Satanist.They have not changed since I left, they still look at me as If I were an outsider. I would say the following to their faces, but It would ruin my reputation as the good guy.
"Why do you shun me? Do I offend, is it my appearance that makes you shy away?"
I gave you a chance, I never was hostile, yet you won't even let me join the conversation. I moved, just so you two could be together, but still you aleinate me.
We have the same views, but you won't talk to me.
I make Jokes, you roll your eyes.
I try to talk, but you only glare.
Why are you so weak?
Are you afraid?
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?!
You are scum.
You are trash.
You are the crap that society forgot to wipe off its butt.
How do you have friends?
Does your family know about this?
My journal unnerves you, but I do not know why.



Maybe someday We will get an answer.
