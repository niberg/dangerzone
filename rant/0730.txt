ENOUGH WITH THE EBOLA FEAR MONGERING AND SPREADING OF MISINFORMATION

Take a fucking virology book out of the library, and fucking read it you god damn imbeciles. 

Unless you are in ***DIRECT CONTACT*** with the infectious bodily fluids of someone with Ebola **YOU CANNOT GET EBOLA**. It is not airborne. *just like HIV the infectious bodily fluids need to be introduced to your blood stream via mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth, genitals) or a break in your skin large enough to introduce it to the blood stream!

**I REPEAT: IT IS NOT AIRBORNE, AND IT IS NOT SKIN-TO-SKIN**

You know when the bodily fluids become infectious?! when the person is already exhibiting symptoms!.

The media is overblowing this. I come from a medical family, my SO is a virologist (People who work with viruses and study this stuff every day).

Hollywood also overblew this with outbreak and contagion.

You people really need to learn how viruses work, because holy fuck. You believe *anything* don't you!? 

Educate yourself on viral classifications, virus types, viral load behaviors, and jesus christ would you fucking listen to the infectious disease experts instead of the media? **BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF THEIR JOB TO KNOW THIS SHIT**. 

Johnny Talking Head from bumblefuck news station knows *nothing* about how viruses work, so why the hell would you believe them over the WHO, CDC, and countless epidemiologists?!

I've had just about enough of this shit. My own father, who is married to a fucking physician, whose child is dating a virolgist, all three of which have spoken openly about Ebola in front of him, got pissed when I was apparently "lecturing him" about Ebola. All I was doing was explaining how, no, it is not infact air borne nor spread skin to skin, that you're only contagious when you have symptoms because your viral load is high enough to infect, and that viruses are not infallible beings. They do have an expiration timeline when outside the host! 

"I don't need a lecture, Iwantrelief" apparently you fucking *do*, just like everyone else.


So here are a few *more* things to clear up about Ebola:

1) Not everyone gets the bleeding. So when hollywood shows you people bleeding out of every part of their body, they're doing that for the sake of the movie being dramatic.

2) It's not the bleeding that kills you, it's organ failure.

3) You have a far better chance at surviving ebola here than in *africa* where the 60-90% death rates come from. 

4) there are 3 strains of Ebola, Zaire being the worst, this one is *not* Zaire.

5) If you survive, you're immune for 10 years

*read a damn book people! Take to a virologist, epidemiologist, and infectious disease expert. IF THEY AREN'T FREAKING OUT, NEITHER SHOULD YOU*

Get a damn flu shot, and get tested for HIV every year. Worry about shit that you have actually a higher chance of getting.

Yes, Ebola, this little tiny filovirus, is ugly. It's not pleasant, it's painful. However, it is not the end of the world, and you're not likely to get it if you practice basic barrier nursing and hand washing. Oh and *if you don't go playing around in the infected bodily fluids of someone with Ebola*. It's a dramatic looking virus, but it's easy to protect yourself from.
