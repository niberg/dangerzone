I'm not a doctor but...

If your tear ducts can't produce tears, maybe you should drink water instead of cases of Diet Snapple.

Jesus fucking Christ.

"I don't like the taste of water."

Do you ever stop to think that maybe your fatigue, headaches, stomach issues, eyes/allergies, might all be ...I dunno... related to the fact that you NEVER drink water?

No?

Okay.
