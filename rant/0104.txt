Fucking pissed at AT@T

So I bought a brand new fucking LG G3, A near 700 dollar phone.

Had it for less then sixty days and the fucking accelerometer sensor doesn't work and the digitalizer has a fucking residue or something I dont fucking know underneath it and is causing discoloration, The battery doesnt charge properly and they are telling me because of ONE MINOR fucking scratch I have to pay nearly half of what I already paid to replace it... I can literally pay 30 dollars to buy a new fucking digitalizer and some UV glue and replace and then there wouldnt be a fucking scratch. THE fucking scratch happened in the first 48 hours of owning it and it was before I got my fucking screen protector. 

PISSED.
