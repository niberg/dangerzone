"Sorry" does not magically make it ok!

**WARNING. Game of thrones season 4 spoiler.**

Im browsing though reddit when I see a status from an acquaintance. 

"Alright here come the water works. Last episode and one of daenerys' dragons kills a 3 year old little girl. So sad right now. Sorry if I just ruined it for some people."

I haven't seen season 4. I didn't want to know and this status has just raped my eyes with it's spoilers. So I reply "Seriously. warn people before giving out spoilers." 

Dumb bitch replies "Already said sorry and honestly that didn't give like anything away. Thought it would when I posted it but didn't." 

IF YOU THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A SPOILER WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE A WARNING BEFORE THE MAYBE-SPOILER?! If you were truly sorry before pressing "post" why the fuck did you post it? Apologizing AFTER the spoiler in the SAME FUCKING POST does not make it ok! 

Edit- 

I replied "If you have to apologize in the original post you are assuming that you have something to apologize for. Apologizing for something generally means you have done something wrong. So if you know you have done or said something wrong why post it?" 

Dumb bitch says "And this is a big deal because?"

Well, it's not really a bid deal... but it is! Giving out spoilers without warning people is such an asshole thing to do! And then assuming that you can apologize for it just to cover your sorry ass is super rude and pretentious! I know I should stop replying. But I want to. I will exercise my self control.
