Roommate won't stop Skyping in annoying baby voice that makes me want to bury my head in the deepest hole on earth

Somebody up there with a higher power, please, please help me to not explode internally (although that WOULD take care of my issue). My roommate and ex-friend Skypes her boyfriend everyday at 1) the crack ass of dawn, 2) in the middle of the day and 3) late at night, always ALWAYS without fail, speaking in a ridiculous baby voice. At this very moment, she's listing out in a baby voice to her boyfriend all the various snacks that her dad is sending her because she's a spoiled little princess and has a diet that includes all of 5 things. This is totally okay but she spews disgust verbally at everything she doesn't like. Dude, that's like one of the basic rules of life in order to be a decent human being--don't yuck my yum. And yes, I understand long distance relationships are hard, but never once has she asked me if it's alright that she Skypes with her boyfriend and it disturbs me in that I can't fall asleep, I get waken up really early, and I can't study without having to listen to her talk in a baby voice and laugh loudly and other shit. 

Not only this, but she gets ANNOYED and mad when I come back late at night after going out and when I ask her to quiet down or go Skype somewhere else. Sorry, girlfriend, I'm a single lady and I'm gonna party like it sometime. "Sometime" being the keyword--I go out once a week maybe and when I come back, I'm either pretty quiet if she's asleep or I'll actually still go to sleep before she does because she's STILL Skyping her boyfriend. If I can deal with your Skype shit every single day, you can deal with me going out once in a while. Although, I guess I can't really deal with it anymore which is why I'm typing this in the first place.

Solutions, reddit? I'm investing in a pair of earplugs because if I listen to any more music with the volume all the way up, I'm gonna go deaf before I'm 30.
