I don't like kids on Facebook.

I feel so fucking creepy every time I go through some kids Facebook. They comment on a lot of public things, and usually have a pic of their weird chubby baby faces. It’s just so alien to me, why is this child on Facebook? what do they have to say? I don’t think they understand the concept of privacy or safety. I could be a total creep and gotten their bikini/shirtless pictures, their names, the names of their school, and just read about what fucking games they like too. Don’t they get bored with Facebook? I imagine it must be really boring as a kid. It’s even really boring as an adult, reason why I ended up looking at these profiles in the first place, and the weirdest thing is that they all look the same and leave really stupid and insipid comments, but I understand that, they’re kids. So, is nobody else going to comment on this? On how fucking weird it is to have a child on Facebook? or the mere fact that children want to be there?
