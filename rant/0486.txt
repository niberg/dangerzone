Westboro Baptist at it again....

First let me give you a back story to this.  My mother recently had a mastectomy for breast cancer and is again cancer free (Second time she has beat that shitty disease since she beat Hodgkin's in the 80's.)  However, breast cancer had its toll, but she is doing well now.  Yesterday at the Kansas State - Texas football game, Westboro Baptist Church was protesting.  They had their typical "God hates fags," "Thank God for dead soldier," etc signs.... But then they had a few more.  One said "Thank God for Ebola" and then the one that really lit my dad's fuse was "Thank God for Breast Cancer."  

Okay, so I understand if you think being homosexual is wrong, abortion is wrong, etc. Fine.  Whatever.  Make your stupid fucking signs.  But to actually WISH someone has CANCER? What the fuck is wrong with these people? I know its not the answer, but I'm so glad I wasn't at that game or I would be in jail right now for aggravated assault.  Man those people piss me off!!! 

Thanks for listening to me, Reddit! Love y'all.
