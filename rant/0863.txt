Dear girl who broke my best friend's heart, screw you

My best friend is the nicest human being on the face of this earth. He is caring, respectful, funny, outgoing, and so much more. For you to leave him because you want to go fool around sucks. He would do anything for you and you walked all over him. We all know you just want to go do your own single thing, and thats okay. I just want you to know, he won't be waiting. Someone lucky enough will stumble on him and get to be with him. You will be sitting at some party with some guy wanting to be held again and wanting to laugh with someone. You will think of him.  But he will be gone. I hope you realize this.
