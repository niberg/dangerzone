To the Communist

Mate. Friend. Comrade. Whatever the fuck. You're really fucking cool and all but would it kill you to at least acknowledge me when I say shit? I mean seriously come on, even if I hate someone I show them that much respect. I get that you've got social anxiety so I do my best to be understanding and give you a fucking hand when you dig yourself a hole and I don't even much mind doing all the initiating most of the time but seriously. The reason I get it is because I have it too, so cut me some slack. *Rolleyes* why do I get the feeling this friendship will never get off the ground... 
And yes, I have a crush on you but fuck that. Seriously. I get you don't owe me anything - people don't work that way - but Jesus, I don't even know if I'm just bugging you, the least you can do is tell me to lay off. At the moment I can't even tell if you're hot or cold you dingdong around so much. At least tell me whether you want me to stick at it or not, Christ.

Also why the fuck don't we have more pumpkin spiced stuff in England Jesus fucking Christ this shit is awesome.
