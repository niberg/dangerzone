I'm sure a lot of you have heard this before, but fuck PETA.

Now, before you say I'm a cruel heartless monster, I love animals and animal abuse is a terrible thing. I actually agree on what PETA is trying to do by stopping animal abuse, but they've barely changed anything. Most of the money they recieve goes towards their retarded ads that feature naked women to capture attention, or killing their shelter animals.

You see, PETA kills almost 97% of the animals they take in at their shelter, yet they are against shelters that euthanize most of their animals. Hypocrisy much? And we haven't even gotten to their ridiculous "beliefs" and advertisements.

PETA wastes their money on advertisements featuring naked women to grab attention. Some of their other ads are even worse. There were the infamous ads that compared factory farming to the fucking holocaust and civil rights movements, ads that claimed eggs were chicken abortions and drinking milk is rape and claiming that milk causes autism.

They claim that there is no way to humanely slaughter animals, even though there are a lot of farms that kill livestock quickly. They are against dissecting animals. Guess what? Most of those animals have been dead for a while, and they are not endangered. 

They've even compared the Greyhound Bus murder (where a man ate parts of the head of another man) to factory farming,and have suggested a vegan diet to a cannibal killer. And we haven't even gotten to their horrible "fans".

Their supporters have said that pedophillia is the same as eating meat. Yes, because eating a burger is the same as raping a 10-year old, isn't it? They've said to replace animal testing with testing on kids. They've even said that all humans are worse than the devil. Yes, because every single human on earth is a horrible, cruel asshole, right?

TL:DR, don't support PETA. Support associations like ASPCA that don't take it to the extreme. PETA, please die.
