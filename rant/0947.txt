I just had to waste time on the phone with my credit card company . . .

Because my card was rejected in the supermarket. Why? Because a hold had been placed on it because "fraud" was detected. 

What fraud? My online purchase of Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV from Steam, which apparently raised some kind of flag.

So I had my card declined, had my stomach turn over because what if my identity really had been stolen? Was embarrassed in front of the cashier, had to repeat the card's identifying info on the phone within earshot of lots of people because I had a cartload of food which I was trying to pay for!

Is there ANY FUCKING WAY I could have prevented this?? Just for making a motherfucking Steam purchase??
