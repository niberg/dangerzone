Dublin Bus will seriously want to evaluate who the fuck their hiring in future!!

I was in Dublin city literally a few hours ago and coming back from a college interview. My Grandmother accompanied me. Anyway i got on a Bus to go back home. Got on the fucking bus put in 4 euro to get a ticket waited patiently for him to print my ticket he ignored me and focused on another man whos bus pass wasn't working properly he helped him out. I thought okay that's fine, i don't mind understandable then a minute later when he was done with the other man, I simply said, may I please have my ticket please because people were getting annoyed standing behind me for ages. He then sarcasitcally and nastingly says ''BAD MANNERS, WASN'T RAISED RIGHT'' over and over  the fucking audacity , I had plenty of manners and I simply said excuse me ! you're the one with the bad banners and he kept on it . Seriously , they are a public service. This sort of attitude towards customers is not fucking acceptable. Argh.
