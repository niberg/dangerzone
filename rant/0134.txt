I'm sick of this misconception about dolphins

I keep reading all of these various comments and articles that talk about humans being the only species that are "self-aware." A few minutes of research will quickly help someone realize how false this is, with dolphins being at the top of the list. They are highly intelligent beings. Some scientists are going so far as to say that dolphins deserve the same rights as humans. These animals have the same "social" needs as us. They, in some senses, have their own civilizations (just not by our definition in the sense of buildings and roads and commercialism, etc.) They have cliques of friends that they hang out with on a regular basis. They have a sense of intellect that is quickly gaining ground. By their use of sonar and cliques and body language they have their own language that scientists are trying to understand so that we may one day be able to communicate with these glorious creatures of the ocean.
