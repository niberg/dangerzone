You know what I'm doing matters, too, right?

When you call, when you want me to do something, when you want to talk to me, that's all great, I'm amenable, but for the love of God, *ask if I'm busy first.*  Or if I even want to talk!  You know I hate the phone!

And if I do have to go--be it because I'm not in the mood to talk, or working for a client--don't pout.  You're an adult.  It's not cute.  One of you, you have forfeited the right to pout, in fact.

Don't just call and launch into a conversation. I work from home.  You *all know this.*

Don't walk into the room and start up a conversation with me as if I was wearing a sign reading, "I'm bored, talk to me."  I'm typing.  I'm clicking.  I'm reading, I'm WORKING.  And if I'm not working, I'm still obviously engaged.  You'd throw a fit if I disregarded what you were doing, why do you get to do it?

I keep to myself on Sunday.  You know this.  I either get zen or I work on things that need focus.  Don't suddenly call in a chit (one you know I won't turn down, because I do owe you) to help me work outside with you on the coldest day of the season--especially when it means it will require me to put off the physical work *I* had planned for another two days.

In short: what I'm doing fucking matters, too.  

tl;dr: Love family, love friends, hate that they assume I'm never doing anything worthwhile.
