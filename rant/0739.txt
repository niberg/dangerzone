Stop freaking caring

So, my parent teacher conferences were yesterday, and when my dad talked to me about them, he said I couldn't take my iPad to school anymore. The reason? One of my teachers had to tell me ONCE to put it away. I listened immediately, but now he thinks that I got a low grade on a test because "I spend my times reading comic books on the iPad rather than reviewing the notes he assigned." Keep in mind, this is before school starts, and I'm pretty sure that's my time to do whatever I want. This teacher does not have enough sense to question whether he may be a hard grader, or think that perhaps the 1st test in any class is difficult, but that me using my iPad on my own time instead of reading notes he assigned( which I did) causes me to get lower scores, and he told this to my parents. Now my dad won't listen to me about the issue and thinks I'm a terrible son who's a slacker. To him and my teacher, I say, "Fuck you, stop caring about a non-issue."
