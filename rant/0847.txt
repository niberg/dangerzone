Why do people think it's funny or hilarious to reference Facebook statuses?!

Maybe this is an isolated problem but it happened to me twice yesterday. 

Before seeing some friends at the mall I just made a casual status about having to use my phone so peddlers won't shove flyers in my face. 

While sitting down with my friends one comes across it on Facebook and starts reading it out loud, really sarcastically. 

I just interrupted her and basically said shut up. 

Then I got my first car that evening, said in the picture it was "no Ferrari but I couldn't be happier" 

My sister comes into my room later and says "so, are you going to drive me to school on Monday in your not Ferrari" 

Wtf is going on? Are these people trying to be witty or funny? Because it's fucking stupid and I can't stand it. I don't need them to repeat things I wrote myself.
