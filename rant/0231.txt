Why do people always fucking do this every election cycle?!

Ok, ok, maybe I'm just fucking naive as shit, but why, why do people on opposite sides of the political aisle always have to demonize their opponents??? I don't mean just candidates, I mean the voters as well. All over the place I see people call each other "scum" or "trash" or "evil" and it drives me up the wall!

I know politics is complicated. I know there is money involved. I know people have differing beliefs, but must we de-humanize each other like this every few fucking years? It just serves to divide and hate each other more...we do that well enough on our own! I just feel lost when this time rolls around...
