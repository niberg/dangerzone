Stop watches in a call center - fucking really!?

Reasonably big call center - had a month off sick, I come back and one team has started using stop watches to control their stats.

Every 5 minutes one goes off and the noise shoots right through my nerves.

My team have been using a *silent* stop watch online for months, so I asked my boss if it would be unreasonable to request they switch to the online version.

Apparently it is unreasonable.

I came so fucking close to buying 600 of them on amazon today.

We'll see how long it takes to ban them from the building when every single employee is using one - fuckers.
