Let me go

I have ended this relationship with you. I did it because I didn't want a relationship anymore. It is not your fault. Let me go. Move on. Please. I've had enough of you. Find someone else to annoy but not me. I'm not the one for you. Just remove everything you have left of me and delete my number.
