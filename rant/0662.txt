What the FUCK is this stereotype about Australia being the home of all deadly creatures and insects?

What the fuck is this shit? As an Australian, I can confirm I have never seen a snake in my entire life, and I haven't seen a spider in over an **entire fucking year**. The most deadly motherfuckers out there aren't even in Australia. Get rid of this fucking stereotype.
