College is killing me.

I know, every student goes through that point when they feel like they just can't deal with college. I just feel like I have never been this stressed out before. With this being my first semester out of high school (second semester as a college student), I knew it wasn't going to be easy. But I'm relatively smart, so I thought that I could handle a larger course load than I'm used to. All of these classes just keep piling up and all of them have the same schedule of tests/papers and so I end up having 4 things due in one week. 
On top of that, I've barely had the time to work it seems (even though I work 25-30 hours a week) and I'm just not making any money (I'm a waitress). With $350 in rent, $150 in electricity, internet, and other bills, plus a $125/month car payment for a car I just bought, expenses are not in my favor. 
Within the past month and a half, I have had a pet die, found out that my significant other (who I live with) cheated on me, and had to buy a new car because my other one broke down. 
On top of not being able to see my friends from high school every day anymore, I haven't had much luck making friends at college because I usually go straight home from classes to work on homework or go to work. I just feel like I have nobody to talk to any more. I miss having people I could just drive around with and talk about life and smile and laugh, but I dont' have time for that any more. And it fucking sucks. I hate feeling alone and stressed and broke and I don't know what to do. I can't drop any classes or I won't graduate on time. I can't work less because I already can't afford to pay bills. I could move back in with my parents, but that would be unfair to leave my roommate with half of the lease left. 
I just found myself crying on the floor of my study room because I'm so stressed and I don't know what to do and I don't have anyone to talk to. 

thanks for bearing with me reddit. I just needed to get that out of my head.
