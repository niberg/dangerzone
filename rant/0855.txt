Now I remember why I left this town to begin with.

I moved away from my hometown to go to college 3 years ago, a bunch of debt and a few bad choices later I had to move back. I went from having tons of friends, and sisters from my sorority, who would be down to do whatever basically whenever. Give or take homework or work. Now that I'm back it feels like I'm completely alone. I have a great job where I'm friends with mostly everyone, and absolutely love working. Outside of that I have 'friends' who will always bail on plans or say that because we aren't doing the same boring shit every single night out they don't want to go. No other reason than,  oh it's new. I have a boyfriend who I don't think I'm keeping much longer because he does the same shit. In fact I feel so unwanted in all my personal relationships that I seriously just wish that I could always work. That's where I'm happy. 

I miss my old life where I was almost always happy. Because this life sucks. I'm not suicidal, so don't think that, just really wish that I wasn't in this town anymore. I need new and better friends.
