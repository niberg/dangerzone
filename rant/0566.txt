GM recall on certain vehicles, but we will tell you at 11 which ones.

Fuck the news. Fucking end of the 6 o'clock news says not to drive in the front seat of certain GM vehicles that won't tell us about until 11 pm. Even the NBC nightly news will probably do the same thing. I fucking hate these fucking scumbags.
