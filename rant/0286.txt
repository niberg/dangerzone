America isn't the greatest country in the world.

America is by far the most shameful country out there. if you were to compare us to the rest of the world, we rank 1st in incarcerated citizens then any other country, 1st in nation that believes in angel and fairies, and 1st in defence spending, we rank 7th in literacy thats right there is a fucking embarassment, north korea (those evil communist *wink wink*) out do us in that, they're 2nd in the world.

Before anyone preaching, "well we have dat der freedum" many countries have freedom - Canada, France, UK, Italy, japan, South Korea, Germany, and among 100+ other sovereign nations have freedom.

America is in dead last in math, 15th in reading, and what worst is that were 30 when it comes to science, that is an embarrassment to ever nation out there who tries to make life better for people while america is still figuring out which end of the stick go's where. China is out doing us in almost every category and many people seems to believe that china is this cesspool. I'm sorry but america isn't the greatest country in the world, it's FAR from it. I'm ashamed to be considered a america. You should be too, no sane minded individual should be in support of a country that isn't on the top 15 in science, and so far behind comparatively to the rest of the world, even though in "developing country" such as south korea they out doing us.
