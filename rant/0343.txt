Way to ruin your kids child hood.

There's not a lot of things that piss me off especially when its not apart of my life or for that fact any of my business, but the stupidity I just read just hit me in the wrong way.

I believe that everybody has their own right to raise their own kid anyway they feel fit without other people trying to tell them how to do so. My problem is when you take away a key part of your kids child hood like... Halloween.

I was just browsing through Facebook and my sisters friend said something along the lines of "it was an interesting night" a friend of her's asks if her two toddlers got a lot of candy "oh we don't do Halloween, but we had a nice family dinner"

I dunno how or why that pissed me off so much but it did. Now I know she is a bible belt type of women, but I know some people like that that are alot more hardcore who absoloutly love Halloween.

I understand that you wanna be protective of your kids as a parent that's your duty, but taking away a key thing from your kids is fucking stupid and not letting them form their own opinions on what they should and shouldn't believe is moronic.
