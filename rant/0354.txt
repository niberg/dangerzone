Watching Hobbit endlessly

Jesus you watch The two Hobbit movies all the dam time its like the only movies you watch!!!! Why are you so obsessed with them??? This year alone you must have seen them both 5 times each whats so special about them?? I mean I like Hobbit and LOTR too but not that much. You always complain when you say I rewatch movies but your worse then me you freakin idiot.
