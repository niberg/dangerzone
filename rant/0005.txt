Learn how the fucking internet works

How the fuck do you get into an IB program without knowing basics such as ethernet connections don't effect WiFi and that static pages barely take up bandwidth? But no instead you start screaming at me for apparently taking up all the fucking internet because don't you know ethernet cables steal all the precious internet? Oh or that static web pages somehow are capable of rendering the bandwidth to nothing? Silly me I thought that things like how the internet in our neighborhood is shit and the fact that you watch fucking Netflix all the time would be the cause of that but no apparently my redditing is to blame. And please do just start screaming at me about it I really enjoy nothing more than to be yelled at by someone who can't be bothered to educate themselves on how things work before deciding what the problem is. Cunt.
