My boss hasn't paid me, isn't responding to messages

My boss has owed me money for a length of time that exceeds my contract with that company, but he's not responding to any of my emails or calls. I've normally had trouble getting paid, but not this much. I'm now behind on rent because he can't get his fucking act together long enough to run a simple bank transfer. I'm fucking stressed out of my brain, but I don't want to try and chase it up through official channels, because technically my contract has expired, and if I make an issue out of this, I could lose the work, and I have no fallback options.
