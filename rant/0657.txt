Please! For the love of all that is good and holy, stop using the word "like" in every sentence.

I'm new to this subreddit, so I wanted to start things off with something that truly annoys me, so much so that I sometimes stop talking to someone if he/she uses like excessively. Stop using "like" in every sentence, use the correct word FFS!!! It's not cool, it's not hip, it's annoying, simply annoying.
