People are freaking out about there being propylene glycol "antifreeze" in Fireball whisky. Alcohol is an antifreeze. Sugar is an antifreeze. I would have to drink *1,500 liters* of Fireball to get a toxic dose of propylene glycol.

People are idiots, and the media is encouraging it.

 &lt;/rant.&gt;
