Voter ID [political rant]

Why is getting an ID for voting such a big deal???? Its not like we don't need and ID for almost EVERYTHING! Why is it suddenly racist and classist for people to ask for ID?? They are 25 dollars at the most!! It seems like a responsible person would have an ID anyways. Heck, you need it for a bank account! Stop calling it racist!! This is just about making sure no one cheats on voting twice (which has happened before) so its kind of important for democracy.
