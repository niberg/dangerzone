It's annoying when I can't speak what's on my mind.

The minute I open my mouth about an opinion or something I feel, Somebody gets offended. Not just upset, but seriously offended. I can't speak my mind? I thought this was a place for open discussion, for getting opinions out in the open! Nope, guess not. Example: X kills themself. I can't criticize their decision and call it selfish or say that their bit for attention bringing a hot-button issue shouldn't have been brought to our general attention. So you get offended? And you criticize my thoughts? Fuck you. If you don't like what I think and what I write, don't respond. Simple fuckin' solution to your 1st world problem. If you fuckers can't take someone's opinion on the internet, I'm not going to hold your goddamn hand and tell you it's okay to feel upset and throw a fit about it. Grow the fuck up and realize that just because someone has an unpopular opinion, doesn't mean you have to make them a fucking pariah. This is why I hesitated at making the switch to reddit.
