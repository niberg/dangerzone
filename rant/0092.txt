Dear Roomie

Dear Roomie,

I know that things are hard for you right now. You are going through so much more than any man should have to bear. And that's ok! I accept that you're going to be moody because things haven't been going your way. However, this passive agressive make a demand and then make a threat thing? It's really gotta go. I know that it means a lot to you that people hear you when you have something to say. But there's no fucking reason to threaten to destroy all of my worldly possessions over a flea infestation. Do you have any idea how fucking lucky you are to even be here? Has it even occurred to you that your spoiled ungrateful attitude mixed with your sadistic style of making demands is what got you kicked out the last time? You have absolutely no reason to demand anything when we have graciously given you so damn much. Quit being a pathetic worm and start acting like a grown man with a social conscience. My husband and I will gladly continue our efforts to rid ourselves of this flea problem, and it's valuable information that you found them in your room. But do not EVER come into my bedroom at two in the fucking morning to threaten to destroy our shit if the flea issue isn't resolved. Thank you for your fucking time. Tldr? Grow a pair and speak without having to prove that you're a man. Sincerely, your room mate / sister in law
