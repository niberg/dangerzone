It's not that hard of a concept

If you can see without your headlights, that does not mean you don't need them. I was almost hit at 40 MPH because I thought I had an opening, but the person I almost turned in front of didn't have his headlights on, so I couldn't see him at all. When in doubt and/or (I can't believe I have to say this) it's almost as dark as night, turn your fucking headlights on because you are a lot more invisible than you think.
