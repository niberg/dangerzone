Peter from Office Space should not have a happy ending

The office burns down, but the electronic records of the transactions are still there. Maybe the company is too busy with the Y2K roll over and the office burning down, but eventually they will get to the records and see that the funds were put into his bank account.

Then it is goodbye nice construction job; hello pound-me-in-the-ass prison.
