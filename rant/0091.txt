veterans day: fuck the usa

fuck our troops. I mean, they joined, they had a choice. Everyone gets all moist about it. Here's the deal: BRING ALL OUR BOYS AND GIRLS HOME! We don't need to be the most powerful military in the world. We need to mind our own fucking business. SO when I say fuck our troops, I don't mean fuck them individually, I mean, fuck combat troops, fuck the idea of it, fuck the generals simply obeying orders, and fuck being xenophobic and fuck being the world police. I have good friends and family members in the military, and all I want them to do is come home, but fuck them for joining. We aren't in any danger that they can protect us from. I'm sure some smart prick will say some bullshit about 9/11 (#neverforget) and I say fuck you, what could a huge military do about it? NOTHING. Now we have the NSA monitoring all our shit and it's not just G.W. Bush's fault. Dang old Obama could have vetoed some of the legislation that expanded these domestic surveillance policies, but instead he signed them with fervor. Bush and Obama are the fucking same. They are. Fuck you, they are. One just comes off as not retarded. Anyways, Maybe no one will see this, maybe 3 people do, all I want my gentle reader to take away from this is bring our troops home. Yeah.
