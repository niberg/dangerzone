the performance on math exams

I study and study, but whenever I sit down and look at the exam i feel like all that information just leaves my brain. This is why i study incredible amounts of hours just to get a 78. Fuck math theory, fuck real analyses, and yet I find it incredibly interesting. Itâ€™s like being in a abusive relationship were my gpa takes the hits. So yea I am pissed /rant/
