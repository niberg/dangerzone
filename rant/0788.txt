Keep your fucking dog on a leash

Alright, dear dog owners. Why do you think that you can let your dog off the leash in areas where you know people are jogging, kids running around etc???

I am not a dog hater but if you cant controll your animal then dont fucking unleash it. 
And dont come with shit like "Oh, he just wants to play". FUCK YOU. I know the difference between "I want to play" and "I will rip your thoat out". 
This goes out to all you idiots who feel entitled to let your dog off the leash in areas where other people are in danger of getting attacked by them or it simply intimidates them. 
Hate me for that opinion? Yeah, I'm fine with that. But when your dog gets shot or put down because it attacked someone, you are the only one to blame.
