People lack respect and common courtesy

I am not perfect, however, I feel like I have a greater respect for people than the rest of the people in the office I work in.

The lack of respect some (not all) people have in my office is ridiculous. I'm amazed by this. We're all grown adults, with good educations, but I guess that doesn't mean anything. 

Today I witnessed someone using the sink, moved to get some water from the water cooler, and then left. The faucet in the sink still had a steady stream of water coming out! what the fuck. it's one of those faucets you have to put in a specific place to shut it all off. If you turn it off all the way, it'll drip. This is crazy! He looked at the faucet then left. Come on dude, you're an adult, act like one. I bet you don't do that at home!

Late last week, I discovered, in one of the bathrooms, I get to stare at someone's booger they put on the wall. Perhaps they thought that it would brighten up the 70's wall paper, but seriously. Another what the fuck. There's paper towels. Use them.

Our company also provides air freshener for the bathrooms. Some people don't use them. Another lack of respect, and plain common courtesy. I was gagging in one of the bathrooms last week.

I don't know why I'm surprised by any of this. Is it too much to ask for a little respect? courtesy? anything that resembles civilized society? Looking forward to what's coming up next...
