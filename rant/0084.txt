If I ask you not to take my picture, I'm being serious and I wish you'd fucking respect that.

I'm tired of going out and having cameras shoved in my face. You're my closest friends, you know I've been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder (don't get me started on the shit related to that). You know I hate the way I look. Why would you think that I'd enjoy having my photo taken and posted on facebook? Why do you think me asking to not be in photo is just me being self effacing? I know how I'm going to feel horrible when I see that way I look. I'd rather avoid the whole fucking ordeal if you don't mind.

So fuck you for those photos you mindlessly took of me with your POS camera and just dumped online for everyone to see. Fuck you for reminding me that you can take 15 photos of me and I'll look ugly in all of them. Fuck you for making feel like shit just because you couldn't respect a simple 'no thanks'.
