Are we so focused on equality that opinions are no longer allowed?

So I saw someone post a news story on how UK schools want to teach British values rather than gay equality, and OP was bitching that teaching equality is far more important.

Is this how far we've come in our society? I'm all for gay rights and equality but don't some people deserve an opinion? Even if that opinion is that they don't believe in gay rights? Are feels more important than beliefs now?
