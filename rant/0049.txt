People at college who don't appreciate what they have.

College is damn expensive. Not everybody can afford to go. I'm here, studying engineering, which isn't a bullshit major I selected just so I can have an excuse to go to college and party my ass off. I'm here because I want an education. I want to make something of my life, and here I am working for it.


Yet it seems like everybody here's skipping classes, blacking out every weekend, hooking up at every opportunity. Wasting daddy's money while choosing the easiest major so you can party all the time.


I see all of you filing your nails and gossiping while in the library, or talking about what chick you fucked this weekend. You're in the dining hall, whining about god knows what. You're at the gym, working out just so you can look good for somebody else. 


I'm here on a scholarship, on top of my instate tuition. Why the fuck are some of you guys paying upwards of 50k to bum around? 
I truly hate some of the student body. You make me ashamed for being at the same school as you.
