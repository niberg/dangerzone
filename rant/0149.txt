Our society has become exponentially confrontational about everything

Nowadays everything is an insult, everything is racist, everything is cultural appropriation. Everyone needs to be angry about something in order to feel like they're going to make a difference, and therefore like they have value. They need someone, anyone, to be "oppressed", so they, the almighty savior, may swoop in and come to their aide. There needs to be a constant supply of things to be angry about, too, so many people just make up crap to get attention.

I'd bet you 100$ she met one UNEDUCATED white person. and i say uneducated, because you can't clump someone into a group because of their color or gender. It is the uneducated people who do stupid shit, white, black, man, female, it doesn't matter.

NEVER compliment a woman. Don't even talk to her. Don't look at her. Don't even sense her presence, or you're a misogynist. All of this crap is just women telling other women it's ok to be rude. If someone says you have nice eyes, say thank you. Don't make a scene and tell that person how sexist they are. 

A man isn't automatically a sexist, a white man isnt automatically a racist, a woman could just as easily be a sexist, just as a black person could be a racist. It's never about race or sex, but whether or not a person is just an A-hole or extremely uneducated.



ANGER
EVERYTHING
JUST ANGER
