So many things on Pinterest are completely ridiculous. I can't stop looking though.

It baffles me when ppl pin something like "don't ever buy cleaning products again, here's how" and it's a way to make your own but you still have to BUY all the stuff to make THAT.  Or that "cardboard slide on the stairs" and everyone comments 'ooh that's the best idea ever!', yeah so is a trip to emergency because THATS THE FUCKING stupidest idea ever!! At least at a playground they land on sand! It bugs me so much but I can't stop looking at all the shit.
