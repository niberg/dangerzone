The Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame is a fucking joke.

***Lou Reed has been nominated 3x, none since 2001.***

Stevie Ray Vaughan isn't in yet. Kraftwerk isn't in yet. The Smiths aren't in yet.

Motherfucking Green Day and Nine Inch Nails will probably be first ballot.



ABBA, Alice Cooper, Blondie, Fats Domino, Hall &amp; Oates, Madonna, John Mellencamp, and The Petenders are already up in that bitch.

Besides the fucking debacle of TERRIBLE female vocalists covering Nirvana songs for their induction, besides the b-rate productions each year that can't even make it to network TV, you suck the ass right off of so many 'artists' who were not much more than publicity vehicles. People whom put in shitloads of time effort, suffering, and talent just to be heard, take a back seat to talentless, derivative BS.

If Sting makes it in SOLO before Stevie Ray Vaughan, riot.

If Green Day makes it before The Misfits, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag and a million other bands burn the fucking place down.
