WHY THE FUCK ARE WE LETTING PEOPLE OUT OF LIBERIA AND OTHER EBOLA HOT SPOTS?

Seriously, what is going on? We now have a [nurse in Spain who contracted Ebola](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/spanish-nurse-first-person-contract-ebola-outside-africa-n219581) and realized she was infected while on holiday. She had treated patients who were air lifted to Spain after contracting Ebola in Liberia. Can we please stop taking this people out of Africa? Listen, I love Africa, I have been to many countries all over Africa, but I am sorry, we need to quarantine this.
