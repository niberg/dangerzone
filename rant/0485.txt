DO NOT ask a shy person why they're shy.

Don't. You make the whole conversation completely awkward and what do you expect them to say? What, are they going to open up about their life story of how they are shy or if it's anything else, to a person THEY'VE LITERALLY MET FOR 5 FUCKING MINUTES. It's fine if you're tight with the person, but just saying it randomly is a dick move and pointless because as if you're going to get a answer from them.

SO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD QUIT ACTING LIKE MR/MRS PSYCHIATRIST WHEN YOU HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THE FUCK YOU ARE DOING.
