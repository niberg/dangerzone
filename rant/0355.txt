My friend ditched me for Halloween after we made plans for over a week.

I'm a guy and she's a girl. I have depression and a lot of problems and don't have a friend in the world. This 'friend' of mine, let's call her Jane. Jane and I were planning to hang out tonight and go trick or treating at some of our friends houses. Today I texted Jane and she said, "well, I didn't think the plans were definit so Im hanging out with my BF tonight." We explicitly made plans, and this is a BS response. 

I'm done with Jane. I'm so lonely and my depression is killing me, and stuff like this doesn't help. I'd rather be even more lonely than to have friends like her. This isn't the first time she's done something like this though, but it'll be the last.
