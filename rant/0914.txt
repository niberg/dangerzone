Being around a certain individual literally makes me want to vomit.

This person [F 17] that I have to work closely with has quite the reputation for "getting around". She has been known to have sex with anything that walks, however more recently the situation has hit closer to home and has become **much worse**. Said person has apparently fucked my best friend's brother who is also one of my friends (*important note: my friend is only 15*). Not only does it piss me off that she fucked my friend, but that in my state he isn't even the age of consent, therefore making it rape. As if that wasn't bad enough, she is also apparently screwing around with a 35 year old with a wife and 2 kids. How ridiculous is that? 

**It literally makes me physically uncomfortable to be around her.**

TL;DR: [F 17] fucked my friend [M 15] and [M 35, wife and 2 kids], makes me physically uncomfortable to be around her
