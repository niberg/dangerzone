'Go Ahead And'

Fucking hell.

I am currently ploughing my way through insane amounts of technical instruction videos on Youtube, and also a few paid service websites, and I swear, I am nearly at breaking point...

The reason?

"Go ahead and".

Instructional videos should be as neutral and clear as possible in language, with the focus on the instructions, so why in the name of FUCK do all the people who make them insist on saying 'I'm going to go ahead and' before every bastard instruction?  It is EXTREMELY grating and annoying, and really distracting when I am trying to get to the core of the information.

'OK, now I am going to go ahead and click right here'

should be...

'click here'.

Jesus CHRIST, it is like Chinese water torture.

I am not alone, it would seem, with this...

I am going to go ahead and put a link here for you...
