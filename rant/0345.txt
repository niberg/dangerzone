You're a manager and can't even fucking spell?!

I'm at my wits end with my manager. I'm to the point that I may even boot her the Fuck out and take her position...I mean I do her work for her as it is!!! 

Every fucking weekend I come in at 6AM to find notes on every wall in every room, including the hallway, where you spell the smallest words incorrectly! Like seriously.."I know" is not "I no"....tomorrow is not tomrow! 

If you are going to be in management then at the very fucking least learn how to spell!!!! Youre supposed to be a role model for the staff and you continue to make spelling errors that a first grade child doesnt even make! 

I hate unprofessional fucks!
