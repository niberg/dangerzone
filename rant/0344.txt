Worst $20 i've ever spent.

So it's supposed to rain all day today, and my only umbrella is a tiny $9 thing that I bought a few weeks ago on a budget. 

Well this week i've been carrying around too much money ($100 to be exact) so after getting breakfast I went to CVS to get a new one, figuring I could give my old one to a coworker if we decide to leave together again. 

So i find this $20 thing, collapsable and has one of those sheet things to put it in so it doesn't drip all over the place, and it's nice and big so I don't feel like an idiot using it. I buy it and a few other odds and ends just because I want them and don't want to keep carrying enough money to warrant a mugging. 

It didn't last 30 minutes. The route I take when walking through town can be pretty windy, so it does that inside out thing a few times and I fix it, closing it up for the worst of it. About half way to my final destination it does it again, only this time 3 of the rods that lets it keep its shape snap and the connections to the canvas tear off. Ruining it completely. 

Are you seriously telling me a $9 umbrella that i'm 90% sure is meant for little kids is stronger than a $20 one? For fucks sake man, I should've just gotten a poncho or some shit.
