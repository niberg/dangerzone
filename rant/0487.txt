why is it at there are many people who doesn't give a shit about friendship??

there's one time, it happened recently, when I asked my friend that recently broke up with her bf, "hey, share to us what happened" and she's like "why would I?", and I say "I'm just concerned and all you know, we are all friends after all", and she says "LOL haha you're gay hahaha", then she proceeds to ignore me and what I said. It's hard to express how you are really concerned about the state of your friends, plenty of times, they think that "being concerned" is a gay thing. There are times that you're really concerned but you cant say it to them in fear of maybe they would think that you're gay and shit. why are people like that? *sighs*
