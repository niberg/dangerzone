Rant on Posters and Publications

This happened today so I am typing it now while it is still fresh in my mind.

Start Rant --

Today I was at a meeting at work (work in healthcare) and a list of the entire organization's publications was displayed on paper before everyone. I was pretty excited because I knew that my name was supposed to be attached as a co-author to one of the posters presented at a big conference that happened about a week ago. I was super stoked about this because I'm still fairly young (20 something) and do not have much in the way of posters, presentations, and publications to my name. SURE ENOUGH, I look at the poster and see that my name DID NOT MAKE IT ON AS A CO-AUTHOR. This is especially frustrating because 70%+ of the data the poster used was collected by me. I even looked through all of the other publications and posters and saw my name no where. I do not know if this was intentional or not but it seriously changed my mood for the rest of the day. Eventually I got to the point where I just thought "fuck it" and realized it was not worth my time to be emotionally invested into a poster. Nevertheless, it was still frustrating that my name did not make it on to the poster for which I provided the majority of the data used. So please, if you're printing posters, editing articles, or signing up for conferences, PLEASE make sure that everyone is credited who should be.

-- End Rant.
