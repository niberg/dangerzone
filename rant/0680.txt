rant about r/Rant

OK, not really a rant, but:

I've noticed there seem to be two categories of rants on this sub. One is personal rants about a personal experience or trouble. The other is general rants about society and other bigger issues.

I come here for the latter. No offense, but I don't care to read about how Taco Bell messed up your order and wouldn't even throw in a free Coke even though you had to drive all the way back there because you didn't notice til you got home. And I bet there are others who don't care to read about how the media and advertising have turned us all into consumerized zombies who one day won't even be able to wipe our own butts.

Anyone else think it may be a good idea to somehow separate the two?
