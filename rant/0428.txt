"NEW" Note 4.

This isn't Rogers' fault, but it pissed me off. I upgraded my Galaxy Nexus to a Note 4 on Rogers. I upgraded it in Costco and I was redirected to Wireless Wave to pick up my phone. Note; I inquired twice to make sure the phone would be new and sealed. 

**Rant 1:** Wireless wave shipped my phone to Costco the day I was suppose to pick it up. This pissed me off a little, but not as much as I thought it would. I really wanted to get my phone after I get my case and screen protectors from Amazon. 

I was told the phone would be at the Wireless Wave the following day. 

**Rant 2:** I went the Wireless Wave stand around 4:30PM. I was told that the phone wasn't there yet, and so I waited, and waited, and waited until 6:00PM. When my phone finally arrived, the packaging was opened. I thought it was alright, thinking that they probably just wanted to make sure everything was there. 

And although everything was there, nothing was missing... 

* The protective plastics covering the phone's backing, and sides were removed. The screen's plastic was clearly removed and put back on, indicated by the dirt under the screen and in between the gap of the phone. There seemed to be a little leaf (YES LIKE A TREE LEAF) there. 

* The plastic on the screen has oily smudges all over; it was everywhere; like someone with greasy or lotiony hands just played Fruit Ninja. It was discussing. 

* The battery was removed from it's packaging which makes me think that phone was used. 

That pissed me off properly. I've never experiences such horrible service! And since I've never experienced this kind of service in the past, **what would you redditors do in this situation?** I did not accept the phone.
