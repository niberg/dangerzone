Chairs for handicapped

The local DMV has about twenty chairs by the front door for people who need them. Sometimes I need them and I have the scars to prove it.

Every time, EVERY time, all twenty chairs are full up by healthy looking folks.

Sure, some disabilities are invisible but REALLY?

Every time?
