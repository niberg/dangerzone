He's making me an emotional turnip.

You know, I've dealt with way too much shit from him to keep having my emotions be ground into broken glass. 

First, online cheating. No. There was no physical touching, but planning it is just as bad! Ohh then the actual cheating. That felt good too. But I stayed. Because I was a forgiving person. I've always been. 

Then some lies. I stayed after those. After every single promise that went sour or that was just said to buy some more time. If anyone knew just what went on? I'd be looked at like an idiot. Who is dumb enough to deal with all of that? 

And now.. A workaholic. Leave at 4 am. Get home after dark and then need to work on "shit around the house", but losing me would be like murder..? 

I'm officially a turnip. Isn't this some kind of abuse? It sure feels like it. But I will never, ever admit any of those things happened. Because I love someone enough to let them hurt me and I stick around. So sorry bringing it up hurts HIM. How silly of me.. Somehow, I've made myself believe, I'm ugly and crazy enough, that no one else in this world will want me. What. The. Hell. 

Are turnips good fried, by any chance? I'm emotionally, physically and mentally 'fried'.
