I'm always the "unpopular opinion" person..

First of all, the only person who agrees with me on my opinions is my boyfriend, who I love and respect very much, and am glad to have him by my side. 
Along with that note, EVERYONE ELSE thinks that my opinions are somehow immoral, or I'm just evil.
Here are the things I am for/believe in (or don't believe in if stated as such).
-Pro Choice: as a girl who got pregnant at 17, and would have been forced to no longer have a life of my own, and live off minimum wage, yeah, I had an abortion, and I was for abortion BEFOREHAND.
-Atheism: I am an atheist, and I'm sick of hearing how I'm evil, and how I just don't know God, and having religious people talk shit, and yet except atheists to keep their mouth shut. (I live in Texas...so yeah).
-Assisted Suicide: If I'm dying of a terrible illness, and am CERTAIN to die. Fucking put me out of my misery. I hate how people claim its "selfish". Like seriously? IM selfish? This is MY BODY, IM DYING, you have NO RIGHT, to tell me I'm being selfish.
-Gun Control: I believe that everyone should be able to carry a CONCEALED hand gun after going through a THOROUGH psychological and criminal background, with the training involved. Guns CAN protect you, and if they're outlawed, people would just get them anyway (same as drugs).
-Mentally ill: I believe that if someone is mentally ill or severely disabled, they have no purpose in this world but to just rot with it. They cannot work, they have to be babied their whole lives by SOMEBODY, and for what? Because we're "human"? I understand that Hitler was a bad person, but he had a good point of making a dominant race.
-Reproduction of the mentally ill and/or disabled: YOURE IDIOTS! I know it's rude, but seriously, if you have something that can be passed down, why have a fucking child? The chances of your kid having what you have or worse, is high. And because of this, there are people running the streets that are rapists who haven't gotten caught, serial killers, and diabetes and cancer are being handed out like we're all on Oprahs fucking show! (I understand some of these are contracted through other means, but genetics has a good part in mental illness)
-Bullying: I have been bullied my whole life, but did I ever become a pussy and tell on them or play the "woe is me" card? NO! I fucking stuck up for myself, and showed them I'm not one to be messed with. I'm tired of kids these days being a bunch of fucking pussies and just SITTING THERE. It's not as bad as people think it is, stand up for yourself if you're that sick of it. Otherwise I have no sympathy for you.
-Weight Gain: Ok, I love how women are gaining this confidence that they are bigger, and still beautiful. Sorry but...that doesn't make you healthier. Take that confidence and turn it into making yourself into a fitter person. There is no such thing as healthy at every size. And if you keep saying that, you're gonna die of a heart attack or diabetes, while I'm sitting here laughing because you said I was "an anorexic Barbie bitch". LOL!

Sorry for the rant...I just really had to get that out there.
