Why do I love you?

You lied to me about everything. You used me for all that you could. You cheated on me countless times. You made your friends and family hate me. You put me three grand into debt. After ruining my life, why do I crawl back to you? Every time I reach my limit, every time I tell you how much I hate you, every time I block you, and every time I unblock you months later. Every time you act like nothing happened, you tell me that you missed me, that you were scared I wouldn't come back. I was raised to see the good in people. I was raised to believe that even the worst of people are full of pain and sorrow. So I convince myself that deep down you are just a hurt person. That you desperately want to be loved so you reach out to all of these people looking for something that isn't there. And that's why you hold onto me. Because you know that I love you. You know that I can't escape. You know that in the end when the world falls apart and there's no-one left to comfort you with sex and false I love you's, I'll be there. And at times that doesn't sound so bad. Sometimes I'm so caught up in my thoughts of you, being used doesn't sound so bad. I think, maybe if I endure how awful this feels it'll eventually get better. I'll numb myself to it. I'll be the best friend I can so maybe someday at least she'll see how much I love her. She'll realize I've always been right beside her. But sometimes I connect a few dots and begin to think, don't I deserve better than this? I don't know what I expect to change. Whether things stay the way they are now, we get back together, or we never talk again, I'm going to be hurt.
