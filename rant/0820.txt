I fucking hate Madden Mobile

I have been playing madden mobile for a while and my team got good. Today there was this event where you could trade things you got from the event for 'a large quicksell item.' This means that with the required materials you can get this thing that gives you a lot of coins instantly. These required materials cost about 150,000 coins, so I expected this to give you at least that. I trade in the materials and get a... 300 coin quicksell. I wasted 150,00 coins to get 300! It was advertised as a 'large' quicksell, but the fact that it was worth 1/500th of what i paid determined that was a lie. So fuck you, EA.
