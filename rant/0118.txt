The 'Satanic' message of monster....... LEIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH JUDGMENTAL PRICKS (yes that was intentional, I'm fully admitting I'm a judgmental prick with opposite views)

So I woke up today with this video being sent to me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bntfUA6TmLs

So naturally I was jolted awake with my various levels of disagreement. (Before anyone wants to argue my points, lets agree to disagree now, what is considered to be 'satanic' I consider it to be smart-ass/sarcastic.) I guess trigger warning has been stated.

1. The 666 point: Although the point she made with the hebrew character on the far right of the logo does represent the number '6' the previous two similar characters are connected, to me it looks like the character for tav.

2. The cross on the can/ it being inverted while drinking: Alright I'm only saying this once, THE FUCKING INVERTED CROSS IS THE SYMBOL OF SAINT PETER! The satanic cross looks nothing like an inverted cross. So drinking monster makes us more like st. peter, see the image for an image of the actual satanic cross [](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130922004857/symbolism/images/5/54/Leviathen.jpg)

3. BFC translation: Yes it does translate the B.F.C. on the side of the can, it reads 'Big Freakin Can'. 

4. Crazy old woman: Its fine to have an opinion, I can't argue that she has the right to voice her opinion. Hell this whole post is me voicing my opinion.

Is monster energy drink good for you?

Debatable, medically speaking its probably the equivalent of chain smoking (yes I know different organs are harmed for each, just illustrating a point) It will end up majorly harming you.



Energy for various tasks, Hell yes. I get pumped up for anything by drinking a mega monster. 

Anyhow, thanks reddit for allowing me to rant for a bit on this.

Peace,
