When are all these new hybrid revolutionary materials going to start revolutionizing things?

It seems like every week I see something about some new material, or state of matter that's going to REVOLUTIONIZE the way we make energy, or filter water, or build stronger things.  Are these really taking this long to develop, or is it just way overhyped?  I'd love to see this shit in the real world, but i don't feel like it's ever going to actually happen.
