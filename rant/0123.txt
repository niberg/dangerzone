I hate the way my brain functions when I'm crushing on someone...

I over-analyze every fucking interaction we have, get annoyed when I don't get to see them much, care a lot more about how I look when I know I'm going to see them throughout the day, and think way too much when they don't reply, I hate this dslfkjsdlkjflsdkjflsdkj. I just want to relax and not give a damn but that's proving to be really fucking difficult and its like I can't focus easily when my mind is on them. Maybe vitamin B12 would help at this point because I do feel distracted on random days (with thoughts not involving them/anything to do with crushes/lust).
