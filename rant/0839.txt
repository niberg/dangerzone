"Family Time"

So maybe I'm not around in the afternoons, but that's because I joined drama club. God for-fucking-bid I actually want to get involved and do things at the new school. I don't want a repeat of last year, where I spent every afternoon lying in bed on the internet because I didn't want to get involved in anything at a school I was going to be for a year. I'm graduating here. I'm trying to make friends. I don't understand what the fucking issue is. 

Now, tuesday I go to that bible thing, because you want me to go and make friends there. All the people there are mainly assholes, except the ones who are moving soon. Thursdays I'm not home because I meet up with a friend from three moves ago. We go to the fucking coffee house and study. Fuck knows I don't get homework done when I'm, at home, so I don't see your issue there. I'm actually getting shit done. I'd think you'd be happy about it. 

Was I home yesterday morning? No. Why? Because I had the **fucking SATs**. Afterwards I wanted to decompress a bit, but no, you wanted me home so I could sit around and answer the same questions about college again. 

Today I want to go shopping.For a bit. Because I hate everything in my wardrobe. I know you don't like my style because you think it makes me look like a dyke. Your words. Thanks. 

But no. We have family over. So we are going to watch the on post football game. And shoot guns. 

I like shooting guns. Not with the family. It's busy, stressful, and annoying. 

I do not give two shits about football.

But we have to "hang out as a family". Which always means doing things you like to do. 

I'm so fucking done with this shit. I want to be able to do things I enjoy, but you're annoyed at the things I do already. And when you drag me along to this shit I have to smile and play nice or I get yelled at.

Fuck this all, I'm tired of it.
