Why the fuck do people write an acceptance speech for receiving reddit gold and/or upvotes?!?!

Seriously this shit really annoys me, do they expect somebody to say "you're welcome man" or something? Nobody gives a fucking god tittyfuck shit whether you received a fucking gold icon or not.



edit: Wow this blew up! 54 upvotes thanks guys!

edit2: GOLD!! Thankyou kind stranger!!
