Fuck you USPS

So I ordered a video game on September 25th and the estimated delivery date was October 1st since I selected fast and free shipping. Well I still haven't gotten my fucking game yet because the USPS office that's right down the street from me decided that having individual mailboxes in each apartment building was too much of a hassle for them, so they installed a few giant mailboxes outside the main office. Since they changed the mailboxes, we haven't gotten any fucking mail from them since the third... And I have no fucking clue when I'll get my damn game! The tracking number states that it's out for delivery, and this was on Saturday... No updates or anything! It's been almost a week since the estimated delivery date, fucking hell. Also I have no clue if we got any bills in the mail either.
