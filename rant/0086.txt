"If Obama is for it, then I am against it..."

My parents are extremely conservative, so because of this they are against anything Obama supports. As many of you know, Obama has recently voiced his support for net neutrality. Because of this, my parents have suddenly aligned themselves saying that anything that is related to the support of net neutrality is bad.

I've tried to get their opinion on this, and they claim that net neutrality somehow means that the government is allowed to control and regulate the internet and decide what we see and how we see it. My face dropped and my jaw still hangs open from this illogical point of view.

After trying to calmly explain to them that net neutrality, with the base word neutral, means that the internet is open and free without the intervention of ISPs or the government in regulating it, they still refuse to believe me. This is something I've been trying to explain to them for months, and they are still paranoid that it's some kind of conspiracy to control the people's rights.
