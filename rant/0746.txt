Sometimes you should just listen to your veterinarian. I'm really not a moron.

Alright, so if you bring your dog to the veterinarian, be prepared to receive some advice. It's what I do, it's what I'm trained and paid to do, it's what you should expect.

You should not expect me to happily do what you tell me to do with your dog. You should not tell me how to treat your dog's disease, even if your housewife ass has spent the afternoon googling it while popping mother's little helper. I don't care what the blogger said, I'm a fucking doctor.

If you think my medical advice is worthless, expect to be shown the door. Do not for one second believe that I will do whatever you tell me to do simply because my predecessor did. I'm here and he lost his license, that's not a coincidence.

And, finally, if ever again you threaten any member of my staff with pepper spray - because they offered to help you to your car - I will forget that you are a woman and I will knock your teeth out the back of your dumb fucking head.
