If only blood were legal tender...

I'm annoyed as fuck for still having to depend on parents for money. Read an article about how Taylor Swift pulled all her music from Spotify because she "didn't believe in free music" when art has "so much value". Excuse me, but Mozart's work has way more value than yours, because it took one man to create a masterpiece, without a computer, a lyricist, a make-up artist, a cameraman, etc.

Everytime I see something that I want from online, I either have to pirate it or am tempted to just cut myself so I can pay for them, because this is what big business is doing to everyone but themselves: sucking the life out of everyone by putting people out of work and putting them through hell in shit working conditions.

I envy those who have financial independence, especially if they are around my age (16), because they have access to the resources that define them, from clothes to music to lessons to even a new place to live in.
