Dear best friend

Your girlfriend is a total bitch. Lies to you, she's sneaky, flirts with guys, and then gets mad at you when you become suspicious. Theres a reason my girlfriend and her are no longer friends, because yours is a complete douchebag and lied to you (and all of us) and started shit between us all. Not to mention when you caught her sending flirting texts to a guy "friend" you went to my girlfriend for help and advice. Once you got my girlfriends advice you went and told your girlfriend everything mine had said which started a whole bunch of new shit. I don't understand how despite knowing everything bad she's done to you, and as sad as she's made you, you still have your head neck deep up her ass. It is also annoying that you try to (nonchalantly) build yourself up against me by acting like you're the better boyfriend because you buy her a ton of stuff. We have grown apart since you met and became totally obsessed with this demon spawn. However, I on the other hand have a girl who never lies to me or even talks to other guys, we're close enough to say and do anything to one another and it's never weird. My relationship to this point has been stress free in this way. I am extremely happy. So know this, as much as you think you are better than me, and want to succeed in your relationship more than you want me to, remember: I am winning.
