Grades on tests

I'm a high schooler, and there is this one kid in my class that is a complete douchebag. Whenever he gets like a 98 or a 99 he says(quoting directly)," 98? I could've done better!" and he says that out loud. I told him not to do it because it can make some people mad. I'm not jealous, just that he is bragging about his grade. But instead of doing what I said, he keeps saying that shit over and over and over. SO FUCKING ANNOYING. So I proposed a questio to him about if he got a 72 and someone else who is dumber got 99 and said the same thing, how he would feel. He didn't say anything. He didn't respond. He is so cocky and arrogant too. I wanted to punch him in the face so hard that day. Someone tell me how I could not murder this person and deal with it nicely. He continues to do it to this day.
