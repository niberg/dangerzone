Get off of r/rant and open your mouths!

Sorta meta post here, but I was browsing through this sub and noticed something. I feel like have the things people rant about in here could have been better avoided of the person involved would of just said something sooner instead of keeping their mouths shut til they could get on reddit and complain here. Maybe you should've told your sister you though her making out was gross and then maybe she wouldn't blow that guy. Or maybe if you asked your partner "Hey, this is a group project. Are you gonna let me do any work or should I just take a nap?" you would't have sat in anger for 9 hours. Grow some balls and confront your problems instead of waiting til your completely pissed off to come complain here.
