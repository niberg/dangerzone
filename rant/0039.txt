Roommate Issues

He is seriously driving me up the wall.
About 3 months into college now, I'm having some trouble meeting decent people, but it's going okay-ish I guess. I've met some people which is nice. So my roommate is a pretty quiet guy, we talk a little in the room and between us there doesn't seem to be any obvious conflict.

Every few nights though, he likes to bring in a bunch of his friends off our floor and make them laugh and get all hyper and act like a total shithead. Most of our floormates are also assholes. The problem is whenever I try and talk and get involved in the conversation, they all turn pretty quiet and this fucker turns into an absolute bully! Like, he says shit that gets everyone to laugh at me, I feel humiliated, and I know if I try to bring it up with him he'll just write me off as being "sensitive" Like no, you shithead, you act like a fucking middle schooler who gets everyone to gang up on someone in a conversation and constantly laugh at them! It's not fucking funny, you act like you're 13 for fuck's sake. And it's only to get the floormates to like him and laugh with him, it's so fucking sad. 

Am I crazy? Or am I dealing with an immature jerkoff?
