Hardest fucking peer edit

So we're doing everything online and after you submit your essay, you click on the 'peer edit' assignment and you get a random essay. But unlucky me got a girl whose first language isn't english. I really don't want to be an asshole but I'm gonna be an asshole. I don't understand it. I'm not great with grammar myself but it's difficult to read this. I really do feel like a prick, but this essay cannot do. I don't understand why she's in this class. This is a harder english course. I read it over and over again to myself but I can't understand a lot of it. What the fuck are you trying to say-I really wish I'd understand but I can't. My peer edit was due about 20 minutes ago and now I can't edit it more. Plus with the fucking technical issues, it made it even longer. If I don't save within 5 minutes, then it'll lock out and get an error and tell me to refresh the page. Fuck technology, Fuck peer editing. I'm sorry darling, I really really wish I could understand and help you around it. But everything is a run on sentence. 

I feel bad, and frustrated. I felt dumber while reading it. I'd be okay with getting a 0 on this peer edit but I'm not in a good spot to let some things pass. I emailed my teacher about it and he told me to try my best.. I have been and it really is difficult. I revise the sentences for her but I feel like I'm losing the meaning to them because she could be trying to say something else. 

I can be patient with people with broken english, but it's really hard reading their writing. Although I'm completely bashing on this girl's grammar, I'm probably doing a lot of wrong things here too but you know what? Fuck, you, this, is a, rant, i can do what,ever, i want; SEMICOLON!!!.

I used to have a foreign exchange student as my room mate and I'd help her all the time. But it was much easier because she spoke my second language and she could just explain it in that language and I could get her thoughts down in english.
