Everyone can seem to define what they are except for me.

I'm referring to high school in this context. I'm a freshman and everyone here (and, from what I've seen, from everywhere else) seems to be able to identify themselves as SOMETHING. 

What I mostly mean by this is interests. You've got band kids, kids who play Varsity Football (what the hell does Varsity even mean?),  kids with nerdy interests, etc.

But what the fuck am I? I know my interests, but they're barely interests in that I stay unmotivated. Maybe it's too soon, but there's no clique I'm in, and none I could see myself fitting into. Something that relates to this is Halloween. I'd love to get a costume and stuff, but at the same time, I just *don't care*. Similar thing with sports. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with the social aspects of my academic life.
