I can't even complain, because the thing was a gift

I have to keep this short because I need to leave for rehearsal soon.

My mom is a terrible driver with terrible instincts. She decided to get a BRAND NEW CAR, and it ended up in the shop after 3 days because she decided to keep driving when the sun was blinding her, and some hazard tore up the bottom of her car. When she bought this car, she gave me her old one, the subject of this rant. 2004 Honda Pilot, safe car, carries a lot of people or a lot of luggage, great for me. But the thing is beat to shit. It's already gone through $2100 of repairs because my mom never cared that the Check Engine light was on for TWO FUCKING YEARS, and I haven't yet gotten the money to get the body damage dealt with. There is a dent on almost every door from my mom smashing into every fucking thing when she was driving it. 

Now, the worst part is that I'm unemployed. I'm an aspiring actor, so it's difficult to find a job that fits my schedule. I finally got a recommendation to become a driver for Lyft. I went on the 'Mentor Drive' and got a perfect rating from my mentor, 5 stars with loads of compliments. But my car didn't pass inspection because of the fucking cosmetic body damage. Everything works fine, but it looks shitty so they can't use it. They told me to buy a new car and try again. I dunno, maybe I can sell it and get a smaller but nicer-looking car. I would lose the Lyft Plus bonus, but I would at least have a chance at getting a job.
