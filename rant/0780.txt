Why must you come in to work sick.

Well I don't know I figured I would just post this meaningless first world problem issue as a rant here. I shouldn't complain and feel ignorant for complaining since there are people without jobs and way worse off health wise obviously. I just don't understand why people come to work sick. I partially blame management. We work in a restaurant. Though it is hard to see good positive cash flow in the business from what I know, I would still think it be better to send sick employees home with half a days pay then to keep them in the kitchen. That's disgusting! Starting this job to earn a little extra money now that landscaping season is coming a wrap I really don't feel like eating out anymore. I moved to this town a year ago and have yet to meet anyone to befriend or chat with on a regular basis. A guy from work has quit and asked me to go to the bar today and I decided sure finally make a friend locally. Well I got sick because 3 employees decided they had to come work in a KITCHEN making FOOD well being sick. I thought I could suck it up and manage a few hours but nope I couldn't even make it out the door from yard work earlier in the day I was too tired and ill. I cancelled last minute. Oh well. I have two job interviews this week. We shall see how everything goes. Cheers all and have a good week.
