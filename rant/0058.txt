You couldn't let me have just a little bit of a silver lining

It hurt when you broke up with me but I saw it coming. You were so passive and dropped so many hints. Yet, what you said later was what really cut me deep. You know I had no relationship experience, even at age 25. I knew you were too good for me but at least I felt like I had connected with someone for the first time. Yet, you had to tell me that it was all a big mistake and you never felt anything for me. It was 2 months and you're telling me we never had a connection. I needed that little victory but you felt the need to snatch it away. Even if it was the truth, did it have to be said? Now I feel like I'll never relate to anyone romantically and there is no point to anything any more.
