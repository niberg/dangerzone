No, I don't care if you're crying

Does anyone else really hate it when people (mostly women) announce on social media that they are going to cry?

Example 1: This passport process is really long and if I still can't get one after all the paperwork, I'm probably going to cry tbh. 

Example 2: That interview reminded me of the time the team won the championships and omg I'm going to cry!!!

There's no fucking need to announce that you are going to cry. There's no fucking need to announce you ARE crying, especially over small things. Yelling to the world that you're crying because you're upset is a blantant scream for attention, and by that point, why don't people just fucking talk to somebody about the issue? It's also over dramatic for shit like over a passport application. 

Women who do in particular piss me off. It just propagates the image that women cry over everything.
