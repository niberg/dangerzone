Atheism is NOT a religion!!

As much as 'off' is a television station, Atheism and agnosticism are not religions. Atheists don't have sacred texts, they don't involve a collective or individual worship/ritual, and are **not opposed to others expressing their religion in a peaceful way!!!**

This is my rant, I am tired of hearing about atheists in the news being offended by nativity scenes, prayer in school, the word "God" in the pledge of allegiance and so on. Being an atheist doesn't grant you the right to be offended when religion happens next to you or around you.

I grew up as a Catholic, attending a Catholic school my whole life. Halfway through I became disillusioned by the charges of pedophilia against priests and the subsequent cover up by church hierarchy and left knowing full well that an omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, benevolent god would never allow such atrocity. But I continued to study all religion through an new sense of objectivity, learning that there was a lot to love about religion's effect on good, honest people; and how a disciplined lifestyle can create a beautiful culture to be enjoyed (I could enter a mosque and talk with Imams without the mindset that "It was all inferior to *my* religion).

Becoming an Atheist has granted me a better understanding of history, culture and people, without prejudice. So to see someone ridiculing those of faith and principle, constantly berating them for believing in mysticism and fairies and unicorns all under the banner of 'Atheism' makes me shudder with rage.

I became an atheist to get away from the shackles of *"you are not like me, therefor we cannot be friends"*, not to spit on people for the heights of moral superiority. Give up the argument, it is pointless arguing that 'God' or many gods doesn't/don't exist because there is no evidence saying one way or another, just rational thought (which the thought itself is irrational, because what **is** rational thought??)  

Sure, there are many examples of the destructive ability of religion (ISIS, The Spanish Inquisition, The Dark Ages, The Crusades, Religious extremism etc.)  but I have also seen religion give meaning to the lives of people who have none. No atheist can argue for other people, telling them that their belief isn't real and that they are delusional, it means nothing. 

So what happens if an atheist pledges their allegiance to God? Or makes the sign of the Cross in school (something I still had to do)? Or bows his head while facing Mecca? Or celebrates Christmas with their family? 

I'll tell you what happens, **Nothing!!**. There is no atheist god who will get upset that you did something religious, no one is going to take your atheism cards off you. All that shows is that you are happy to celebrate other people's beliefs. It doesn't matter that you don't *believe*, what matters is that you respect those that do. 

TL;DR - If you are Atheist, you have nothing to fear about participating in religious expression. Religion or not, respect others and you will receive respect. Stop being offended by religion or being an all-round asshat in general!
