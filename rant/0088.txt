It seems that a lot of people want old people to die faster, and I'm a bit peeved.

It seems that every time a political discussion that has at least one tiny thing to do with progressive values and people against them, someone will say something along the lines of this:

"Old people dying is good for society. We can get progressive things out the window when they're gone."

Some people say it nicer, others say it worse. I just hate how anyone could ever think this. Whatever happened to listening to your elders, getting some of their well-acrued wisdom, caring for them because they cared for your parents at some point, etc.? It is one of the most selfish things I can think of, waiting for old people to die so your agendas can pass faster.

This might just be my slightly confused and peeved mind talking, but I know this idea can only get worse. I fear that one day we'll be in a world that forces the end of people against a specific bill/law in order to get it passed/enforced quicker.

This has nothing to do with conservative vs liberal. It's a matter of basic morals, and I'm a bit angry that people are willing to drop them in order to get weed legal faster. Even if you're fighting for something good, like reducing CO2, waiting for old people to die is just.....wrong.
