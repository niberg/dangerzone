Why the fuck does my microwave have to beep 5 times when it is finished!?

What happened to the days when a ding was sufficient to tell me that my shit is ready? What genius decided that I cannot be trusted with just one ding, and instead must be poked in the head five fucking times till I get the message? As if I've decided to go for a jog in the 3 minutes it will take to do my popcorn. As if there is a chance that I might have gone to Djibouti or fucking Narnia since setting the timer and the announcement must take that possibility into account.
 
Maybe the machine is announcing to my sleeping family that i have made food for them, or maybe that i need to brush up on my time management skills because I missed the all important 0:01 and for my mistake they must be punished.

Regardless of the reason behind the five beeps, it is painfully clear that it is super excessive - 3 would be acceptable but i maintain that 1 beep/ding is the golden number. I stand by my stupid fucking retarded machine in the mornings while it heats my porridge or whatever the fuck i decide to eat and it shouts "HEY MISTER! HEY MISTER! I'M AFTER HEATING YOUR STUFF! COME AND GET IT WHILE ITS HOT!", meanwhile my porridge is already in hand and i look at my stupid fucking retarded microwave in disgust. Why must you continue to ding even after i open the door? I cannot simultaneously be in Djibouti and my kitchen - and since I'm after opening your door it is fucking APPARENT that I know my food is ready and you need not finish your final 3 dings or whatever obnoxious amount is left. fucking holy wow.
