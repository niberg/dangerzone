I'm tired of this crap

Every single day of school in my life has been horrible.  No matter how hard I try to get a damn SO or even new friends I fuck up and become silent.  What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't know.  My family sucks, too.  I barely ever see my dad and my dogs because most of the time they are away, and when I do I have to deal with my impossible fat brother who is always just smoking.  He ruins everything in my life! Why can't I just get out of this country!  I can't stand how the rich own most of the money and religiously affected ignorance is everywhere! This supposedly "privileged" country has tons of people who can't even afford to live.  I feel that everyone ignores me and doesnt care about my problems.
