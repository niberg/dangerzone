No one wants to listen to you read your reddit page

So I'm at the library doing homework on one of the computers, and this guy just sat down a few chairs away with a girl. I hear him talking to her and I'm not paying attention, but I notice after a little while that he's reading things off from his reddit front page and making sarcastic unfunny comments about every single one. And she's just kind of sitting there laughing insincerely with this "please kill me" look on her face. And now he's updating her on the status of his comments and whining about how many downvotes he's getting. 

Dude:

1. If you're trying to impress her with your sarcasm and wit, it isn't working. 
2. No one wants to listen to you read memes from your front page. Or complain about downvotes, for that matter. 
3. Some people are trying to study. Go be obnoxious somewhere else.
