Fuck depression.

Hi I'm depression, let's be friends. Oh? So you wanna move 1200 miles away to do something you love, and hope that you'll be happy doing it? Haha nope I'm gonna travel all the way there with you, and fuck your world up. Oh? You have a nice apartment, a nice car, a good life; i don't care, I'll fuck your world up. Oh? You're trying to stop using drugs and alcohol to mask me? Here's a bottle of vicodin, wait... That's not enough? Here, have some oxycotin to go with it. I enjoy fucking your world up. Your really nice life is just going to fall to pieces.
