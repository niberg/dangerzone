Stop using that god damned "That's my fetish" scooby doo gif

That fucking gif man, THAT FUCKING GIF. If a post hits the front page, I guarantee you can find that gif in the thread atleast once. The most posted gif on reddit, and it's not even very funny or clever. There are gifs out there which make me lose my shit laughing, but the first time I saw that gif, not a muscle on my face moved. I'm not even going to post the gif in question, because I am 100% sure everybody reading this already knows what the fuck I am talking about. That gif is literally the opposite of original content. Fuck the gif, fuck it's those who post it, and... ehrm... fuck the king!
