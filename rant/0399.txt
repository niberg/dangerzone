Walking on eggshells with Toshiba

I have had my Toshiba Satellite L870 for nearly 2 years, it was a Christmas gift. It worked perfectly well until 6 months ago, when it would not power on. Thanks to an extended warranty, the motherboard and battery were replaced (taking 2 weeks). Fast forward 4 months later, same thing happens and the motherboard is replaced AGAIN, but this time it takes a month. 

Then, not an hour ago, I am watching a movie in bed (lights off), I move to adjust the screen but something isn't right. I turn on the light and the hinge connecting the monitor to the base is BROKEN. Now, I admit that I am not the gentlest of users -- I bring the laptop to work/school everyday and commute via walking or public transit. However, after some research,  I discover this is a common issue caused by bad design. And I'm furious that for the third time in 7 months I have to bring it in for repairs. 
FUCK YOU TOSHIBA. RANT RANT RANT.
