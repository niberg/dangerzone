Why do you even give a fuck?

Yes, I do cocaine, I am an adult, and that is my decision. Why do you even care? I'm not making you do coke, am I? So why the flying fuck do you even care?  Yeah, it's a schedule II substance, sure it can kill you but not with the amount I do. I had to stay up until three in the morning working on a big project that SECNAV wanted me personally to build, you blame me for taking a stim to help me stay awake and not potentially fuck something up so it costs me a future in the Navy?
