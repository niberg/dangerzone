So my friend is one of the Tumblr "special snowflakes" and I think it's ridiculous

It started when she said she was going to ask out a female friend. Then complained it was sad there was some many straight people as a bisexual person and that she actually considered herself as not a gender. Now I don't feel like a women, or a man all of the time but just because you've discovered Tumblr and aren't perfectly secure in your identity doesn't mean you have a legitimate problem. Sometimes I wish I was a boy but I'm not transgender--every teenager feels a little unhappy with themselves sometimes. I don't mean to diminish people with actual identity issues but really? I honestly believe she just wants to be special.  

So I found out she prefers "xe" and I personally though that was absolutely ridiculous and must have portrayed it because she said "on Tumblr you would just be made fun of as a cis straight girl for your opinions on pronouns." Alright but then she assumed I am 100% happy with my gender and whatever because *of course I could never understand as a cis girl.* I don't even think she wants to be understood anywhere except on Tumblr.

To top it off...she thinks otherkin is a valid way of coping with your identity. I just couldn't take it seriously after she said "yes there can be beetlekin." 

And no, I'm not going to retype this using "xe". I mean she's a nice person and all but I really can't agree with her about this.
