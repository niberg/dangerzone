Once a cheater, always a cheater.

First off, I think "once a cheater, always a cheater" is a complete bullshit quote that people who have never been in the situation say when they've been cheated on. I'm speaking from both sides. I've been cheated on. I've cheated. I'm not defending cheating by any means. All I'm saying is I am one of those rare few (supposedly) who will not make the mistake a second time around. 

I cheated many years ago. It's a long story and I won't get into the details. To sum things up, my relationship was in a very bad place and it was about to be over. There was some sort of emotional and mental abuse happening at the time, as well as some substance abuse on both sides. 

I have grown and overcome my mistakes. I truly learned from my mistake and realized how stupid and heartless it was. I can't imagine doing something so low again. I took the easy way out and I was weak when I cheated. It was wrong. I still feel guilty to this day. 

I've accepted my mistake and I have forgiven myself as much as I can. I'm stronger than I've ever been and my relationship is amazing. We've been through it all together. Hell and back. We are both happy now and treat each other with the respect we deserve. We are also now happily married. 

I hate when people say "once a cheater, always a cheater." We all know that "always" is usually not a definite truth. I believe people can change if they truly see why they acted the way they did and decide they need to fix what made them act that way. I hope others out there agree with me.
