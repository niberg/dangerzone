Your house smells like pee and it's really gross

Dear Mrs. R, I know you have three young sons, but they're all old enough to go to school now (and none of them have any disabilities), so they should know how to pee in the toilet by this time. Instead, when I come to clean your house I find the toilet seat in both the kids' bathroom and the one that's like 2 feet from the kitchen to be COATED with dry or semi-dry pee, front, back, and lid. I find standing puddles of pee on the bottom part of the toilet where the bowl narrows and leaves a little shelf. I find splatters and smaller puddles next to and behind the toilet. I find streaks ON THE WALL. Any time the doors to these bathrooms are open, the *reek* of pee wafts out into the hall. There is no sign that you or your husband or your kids have *ever* tried to even wipe up any of this, *ever*. It's well sunk in to the flooring around the toilets. I tried using BLEACH to clean the upstairs floor behind the toilet and it made no difference. It's *disgusting* and it's incredibly unhygienic. I also clean houses for two other families with multiple sons about your sons' ages, and neither of them EVER has anything remotely like this going on. A few spatters, but that's all. I've never, in fact, seen anything like this anywhere ever - I have two younger brothers and I grew up among large families with multiple sons, but I've never ever seen a house where pee was constantly sprayed around with this kind of reckless abandon before. I really hope you are happy with that house, because no one will *ever* buy it now.
