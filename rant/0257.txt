My friends and their "Convention Experience"

Look, I get it, you're not shy to tell me about how well your con/panel/get-together went. Please, *do* tell me about how it went, I wanna know what you got, who you met, what a time you had, if you'd go again, etc. Hopefully, I could join you next year, even though I'm sure I'd be too broke to even consider a budget pass.

..But, with all honesty, I really *couldn't care less* about how many Homestucks, Furries, Ponies, Frozen, Horsemasks etc. "Ruined your experience". Yeah, they most likely know it's "strictly anime" (The most serious, exclusive fandom in the world!!!!!!!!!!!) I don't give a **shit** if you're sick of looking at people in AoT gear. I'm *so* fucking sorry you had to see someone come in as a SAO character. Wow, how sinful it is for somebody to construct a constume of a non-hateful piece of media that you don't like, but thank *god* there was another person that spent equal time constructing one of something you *do* like.

**Grow the fuck up**. You're lucky you get to see this caliber of costume design in person, *especially* outside of halloween. I'm not pleading for others to stay silent about somebody's gettup, but if you openly tell someone you dislike their costume because of it's origin rather than it's quality, you should consider accupuncture with broken bottles. I'm dead fucking serious.
