Wtf is up with my faggot ass life

Everything that happens to me is stupid. 

Example #1: Boyfriend moves out.

Aww, shit. That year of hard work and love? Doesn't matter. Why? Who really fucking knows! But it isn't all bad, because now I can live a nice, happy, simple life, and get to know myself again! Just fucking kidding, he got kicked out of the house he was staying at! Do I want him to be homeless? No. Which brings me to my next example. 

Example #2: Boyfriend comes back.

Which wasn't too fucked up, at first. He's planning on leaving again to get an apartment with his brother. Or is he? Because I haven't heard him mention this once besides the first time. Are we still dating? Well, I don't know! We still kiss and he's still courteous enough to make sex with me when I ask, although he never seems excited. I still get the privilege of doing his laundry and making his food, but this time around I get to feel weird and unsure of where we stand, because you know, why would a grown man want to communicate at all amirite???

Example #3: Cool ass chick at work likes me.

Which is great, I mean she's a great girl. Like, really. Beautiful, funny, 8/10 in the bod, and super fucking persistent. If I act on my instincts in this situation, I am a horrible person. Why? Because she's almost fucking married and she has this fucking girl's name tattooed on her pretty cheating ass neck. 

Fuck, man. I keep inviting life to fuck me and he never wants to use lube. I'm perpetually damned if I do, damned if I don't. Forever. Sigh.
