Why, why, WHY many americans don't shut their doors and windows even though the US ranks so poorly in security. It baffles my mind.

This kinda pisses me off because it really seems ignorant. I come from one of the 20 safest countries in the world to live, being ranked 16th in 2012 or so. And even so, people aren't cheap on the doors and windows; we have metal doors, double and triple locks, double windows. We have walls to protect our gardens and gates that can only be open with a key. Security systems are also somewhat common.

I know it's cultural. I understand that your gardens are open because it's easier to say hi to your neighbor and what not. But people, we know our neighbors and even consider many of them brothers, walls don't really stop us to socialize and it's harder to trespass. 

Also, even though we're very safe, we certainly don't think "oh, you know, it never happened before, so it won't happen ever", until, BAM, it happens and you're screwed. Do you really believe in that kind of luck? That is such a weird way to think. I really think it's not a safe way of thinking, and honestly? Ignorant. I know it comes from the ways it used to be back in the days, everyone was friendly and doors didn't need to be locked, but seriously, people, it's not 1950's anymore, it's 2014 and you come in 88th when it comes to security. Seriously, Brasil is 91st. And it's a violent country in many parts, there's really no way around that. I think people should rethink their priorities. Is it really worth to put stuborness in front of your lives? Jesus christ.
