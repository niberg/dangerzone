Jesus didn't give you that discount, I did!

Working in retail, sometimes I like to put a smile on a customer's face by throwing a little extra coupon on their purchase, and at least once a day someone has to ruin it and - knowing that I am the one giving them the coupon - they go and say something like "Oh the lord has blessed me, he is so good to me!" and I just wanna say, "No, im_probably_drinking has blessed you, I'm good to you!"

Poopie patooie.
