Just leave me alone.

My mom yells at me for studying too much and not being outgoing. Guess what? I have friends and even though I care about my grades I'm not obsessed with them. I just happen to be more of an introvert. And stop telling me that reading is a waste of time, I do not need to spend every second of my life socializing.
