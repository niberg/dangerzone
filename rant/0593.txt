Why are you having your clients beta test your product?!

This seems to be a trend in general, but especially in the Ed Tech sphere. What happened to actually checking if a program, product or LMS upgrade worked before releasing it into the freaking wild? Is it really better to have clients discover issues and then call a hotline, where they are required to explain an issue to a support staff member? Especially, when half the time the support staffer isn’t even aware of how their company’s products are being applied in the real world? This is just cheapness at its worst.
