I don't get why some chick gets to die peacefully just because she's attractive, has a nice story and a fatal disease while I have to stay alive just cause no one wants to help me die.

I mean, I'm totally willing to take a few pills to bow out of the game and reduce competition and resource consumption.

Really, my relationships haven't been able to withstand the fortunes of reality and there's no way for me to stand well and stable, its only going to get worse from here on out.

The alternative is I cost society more by jumping off of golden gate or off a bridge or building somewhere.

I mean, lets compromise: tell me how much I have to save up to go out with pills and or a shot -&gt; cremation and ill hit that mark.

Fuck it, ill put up the money upfront as long as I can redeem for it at any time in the future when I'm ready to go out.

Come on people, aren't you for a good exit out of this life?
