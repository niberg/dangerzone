Am I the only person who fucking flushes?

So I'm just taking a piss, only one pissing, using the first urinal. Two other guys come in and they take the only two toilets, but then they start pissing! They finish and both leave without flushing or washing their hands.

WTF!? There's 5 other urinals and they use the toilets? They don't lift the seat? They don't flush? YOU'RE THE REASON BATHROOMS ARE SO FILTHY.
