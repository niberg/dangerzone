Waiting at a bus stop for an hour and fifteen minutes!

Buses are supposed to arrive every half hour. The 3:00 bus never came; neither did the 3:30. I have two heavy bags of groceries so I'm not going to trudge all the way to the mall to use another bus route. WMATA's website has bugger-all. The driver of the bus that finally came doesn't know what happened. Does anybody know? Does anybody even give a shit? If white people still rode the bus in Northern Virginia, people would care!

Fucking goddamn shitass Third World piece of shit fucking excuse for a transit system! This would never happen in Scandinavia.
