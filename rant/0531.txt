No, you are not entitled to an opinion. No, you are not entitled to an opinion, you stupid, stupid, STUPID IDIOT

I HATE it that people feel they're entitled to an opinion over a subject they know nothing about.

I go to college, and I CONSTANTLY hear people talking about politics, and they're essentially the most ignorant, retarded, absurd discussions I have ever heard in my entire life. 

As someone who studies in depth political ideologies, economies, and the application of political ideologies it does nothing more than piss me off when people think they can just formulate an opinion, and then you ask them

"how do you know?/why is that?" and they say "Oh I don't know, just my 2 cents"

THAT pisses me off to no end. WHAT THE FUCK? WHY WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING AND AT THE SAME TIME BE AWARE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE SUBJECT?

HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

This is the primary reason I disagree with democracy, you're telling me these people that think "Allah and Jehovah are brothers" have a right to vote?

You're telling me that people who say "lol lets just nuke the middle east" should have a right to vote?

You're telling me that people that think "russia is evil and ukraine is the messiah" should have a right to vote?

People, you are NOT entitled to an opinion if you're not well educated in the subject.

I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE COMMON SENSE.

People say retarded things like "oh man Nazis were evil blah blah blah"

Without knowing any backstory to any part of the rise of Nazi Germany.

They ACTUALLY think people voted for him, and that every German just woke up one day and said "you know what, FUCK Jews lets roast 'em"

It's so annoying that people have absolutely zero critical thinking skills, AND FEEL ENTITLED TO AN OPINION

Why the HELL is it not OBVIOUS that if you want to formulate an opinion on something YOU SHOULD HAVE AN IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING?

Ask me anything about European history and I can talk about it, ask me anything about geography, I'm good, political science, military history, the different languages of Europe, etc, I can talk about all of that since I'm well versed.

But why the hell would I just one day form an opinion on aeronautical engineering without knowing shit about it?

It's the same thing when people talk about World War II, Hitler, Nazis, Soviet Union, American Civil War, Politics, etc.

RAAAAAAWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
