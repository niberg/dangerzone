Why are girls such hypocrites?

Why is every man supposed to have a six-pack like it comes free with being a man?

Meanwhile chicks are never expected to work out or anything by guys to "look good".

I don't get it, is that what media nowadays teaches girls? That every guy who doesn't have a six-pack and doesn't look like he just got off-stage from his boy-band concert is automatically not good looking?

Or that every guy with hair is automatically a dirty caveman bum?

I know of several girls around my clique I hang out with that said "I only date guys with six-pack abs", meanwhile if I said something like "I only date girls with huge boobs" suddenly I'd be a douchebag and the worst scum on earth.

So the question... why are girls like this nowadays? They hold men to such a high standard it's insane. I'm a skinny normal looking guy and I'd have to get a six-pack and a boyband gay haircut + skinny jeans to date the nearest fat whale that just washed off on the beach
