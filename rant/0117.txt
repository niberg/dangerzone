Dear Reids: Fuck off.

I'm browsing the web looking for a new oven and come across this.  There is not ONE oven price that is not replaced by "call for price".

What is the point in having a website if I have to _call you_?  If this is how you like to do things (contrary to usefulness and making it more difficult for me) then, I don't want to do business with you.

I suppose you're trying to taunt me with a hint that the savings may be fabulous, but seriously?  With 10 other places I can buy an oven,  the chances that you'll really save me any money are slim and none.  

SO, again,  if you have a website listing your products,  _put the price on the website_ and if you decide to emply Reids's tactics you, too, can fuck off.
