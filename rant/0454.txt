Neighbor is an idiot or an asshole

2 years ago my neighbor moved in and his dog chewed up my cable line, time and again. 
understand this dog is on a chain in the backyard with no human contact ever.

I decided to  ditch cable and go direct tv with 4g internet. Instantly when I get the dish on my house, the neighbor moves his dog to the far end of his yard and cover the spot where my cable used to be. As if he had solved the problem for me.

After too high of prices for poor television and poor internet, I decide to say screw it. the dog is at the far end of the yard now and the neighbor covered the cable so I can get cable again.

one week later he lets the dog off the chain.

Here i am with no tv and intermittent internet... going through this yet again.

I want to confront him but afraid I will let too much anger out and he could just be dumb as hell.
