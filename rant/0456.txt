It's PRIMA DONNA NOT PRE-MADONNA...... holy shit...

I just literally got ridiculed, laughed at, and made fun of my no less than 5 people, because I was trying to explain to them that the expression is "Prima Donna" not "Pre Madonna".  

They just left thinking I'm an idiot.  Good lord.  

It doesn't help that "Pre Madonna" *does* often make sense when "Prima Donna" is used. 

Fuck though.
