The world is going to hell, and I honestly want to save the human race!

This is a bit of a long one my friends. Its not angry, nor disrespectful, or at the very least that isn't my intention.

I **LOVE** EVERYONE!!!!

I love Whites, Blacks, Yellows, Oranges, etc...

I love the Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Catholics, etc...

I love America, I love Russia, I love China, I love  Great Britain, etc...

The thing is, I don't just LOVE you all, I HEAR you all. Everyday i can FEEL the suffering of others, the feeling is almost crippling! I want to burst into tears when others choose to do harm instead of doing good! I am physically stopped by the emotions that run through this world. 

Call me crazy, or call me a liar, its up to your own perception! The fact remains that we as a species are running out of time on this planet. Whether it is through migration, or extinction, that we move beyond this pivotal moment, the **fact** remains. 

On my way to work the other day, i saw a white handmade sign attached to a a power line pole. On it, it read "OBAMA PLEASE KILL ISIS". Something about seeing that sign made me very uneasy, it was the first time I had ever seen something like that in person, and not on reddit where i usually lurk...

I thought long and hard on it, probably too long. I thought "NO, they are human beings. Yes they hate us, they threaten us, they even harm us, but to simply kill them outright would make ourselves no better than they are. They have their own dreams, friends and families. There has to be a better way. We should stop them yes, but we should show mercy!" Bear in mind I'm not stupid enough to expect one to NOT defend themselves if their own life is in danger, and that's ok! If you or your family is threatened with death, then let the very shores of the river styx ripple with your unbridled rage and destroy them before they destroy you! However if you can survive without ~~permanently~~ harming your assailant, then show them mercy. Learn of their life and their ways, and in turn teach them of your own values. Try to find understanding and common ground. Set yourselves rules if need be to keep the peace, but for the sake of our species, SHOW SOME GOD DAMN MERCY!!!!.....ehem sorry. I would rather turn an enemy into a friend and have them at my side, then to kill them and be alone when the next asshole decides that he doesn't have enough room....forgiveness is its own reward...

...i consider waste to be a sin. I hate wasting things. If food is about to go bad and i cant eat all of it before it goes bad...I fucking engorge myself on it to the point of illness. So why should we waste our greatest resource so readily? I speak of course....OF OURSELVES!!! Hairless monkeys that breed and breed and breed, but continue to innovate and create and grow. In the grand scheme of reality, time, and space, it is imperative that we remember that WE ARE ALL IN THIS ONE TOGETHER! While we are stuck in these nearly useless sacks of meat and fluid, we continue to do GREAT things!

Sigh I kinda lost track of where i was going with this so ill just finish with this last paragraph...Guys... all of you! To the internet, to the citizen, to the soldier and the leader. To everyone in the world who worries and fears for our own future in these uncertain times...rejoice! We are on the cusp of a great change! It will be hard....it will be long...but as long as we remember that we are all in this together, we will survive! I believe that we can unify the entire world. I BELIEVE that we can all stand as one people, on our beautiful planet Earth, and i believe that we can and WILL leave this ancient home of ours and ride our vessels of light across the void! The universe is incalculably massive, and their is room enough for all of us. Lets stop the wars, stop the hate mongering. Lets grow old and laugh together at the silliness of it all. Lets move forward as a race and finally just...
... oh well....    **TL;DR** I love you, but i am afraid....
