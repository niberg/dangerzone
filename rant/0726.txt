Fuck You, You Stripey Little Twat

 So there I was, ambling along, minding my own business and wondering idly what to have for my tea, when I felt something land in my hair. 

And then you stung me.

You stung me in the fucking head. Why would you do that?

Nevermind. You're a wasp and being a cunt is wired into your hell-spawned DNA. 

 What are you doing flying around in October anyway? Shouldn't you little bastards be hibernating or whatever it is you do when you're not being hateful little stinging machines?

 What's that bird that impales insect on thorns?

I hope you get caught by one of them and just as it's pushing you arse-first onto a thorn, the bush catches fire. 

Next wasp I see, I'm killing it. With a bit of luck it will be somebody you care about.
