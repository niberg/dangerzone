Hate my life right now, why is everything so fucking complicated.

Confucious once said "Life is simple, but we insist on making it complicated." so why the fuck couldn't we just keep it simple? Right now I'm sitting on so many different options depending on how the next few weeks go. BUT only if certain things go certain ways which knowing my luck, it probably won't because it never does. But why do I feel like the bad guy when I had no choice over it or I had no say in it? Even if it didn't make a difference in the end to me. I still am sitting here feeling like a piece of shit for something that I had no choice over, I couldn't change it even if I wanted to. I just want it to be over and done with already! But the old classic "hurry up and wait" for some reason keeps coming back to haunt me. I don't understand why everything has to happen at the same damn time?! Why couldn't it happen 5 or 6 months ago when I had nothing to do? Now everything is happening at the same time, I'm not a firm believer but if there is something out there now is the time to use your fucking powers and help a brother out, but again it'll probably only be me, working my ass off trying to keep everything in order.

Sorry for the randomness, just typing as it my thoughts put it.
