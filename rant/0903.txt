Wtf is wrong with people?

So I'm waiting for my train and some asshole tells me I shouldn't look so mean and to smile. Are you fucking serious? Where do people get the courage to tell me what to do with my own damn face. I'm not going to smile just because you command me to. If you don't like the way my fucking face looks, then stop looking at it. No one is forcing you to look at my damn face. Anger is a valid emotion and I'm allowed to express it as long as I'm not harming anyone else.
