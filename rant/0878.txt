Just knock again

I was supposed to met a friend to go somewhere today. The friend has no cell phone right now, but no problem because we agreed yesterday that they'll come by my apartment at a certain time and we'll go from there. The appointed time comes, but no friend. I figure they're just late, no problem. Ten minutes goes by, nothing. I hop out on the balcony to look down at the front door - who knows, maybe my buzzer is broken. But nope, no one there. I send an e-mail in case they're still home, then just keep waiting. For an hour.

Finally I give up and decide to go out to get something from the store. I open my door only to see a small folded note fall to the floor. It's from my friend, saying they were there at the right time, waited 40 minutes and then went home since I apparently wasn't there. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 1) Buzz the intercom downstairs. Don't sneak in when a neighbor holds the door for you, BUZZ so I know you're here 2) It's a thick door, you need to actually knock for me to hear you. Polite tapping doesn't cut it. 3) Consider, at least for a moment, that perhaps I'm not enough of a jerk to just ditch my apartment and leave you hanging without an explanation when we planned to meet, so in the course of your 40 minute wait you could, at least once, confirm you have in fact adequately announced your presence by simply KNOCKING AGAIN.
