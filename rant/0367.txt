FML kit kats aren't gluten free

Fucking sleep deprivation.  My daughter is teething and fussy.  my fiance is trying to sleep.  I have been up for three hours and I was hungry because a stomach full of coffee is not a happy tummy.  I'll just have a piece of Halloween candy because it is in the living room where I am hanging out trying to keep the teething baby entertained.

I thought I was being smart going with the one with the least calories per piece out of reeses, snickers, and kit kats because I am on a fucking diet and on my period and it is fucking Halloween and my house is full of fucking candy and we're going trick or treating with the baby later and I have ADHD and I'm unmedicated and did I mention there is at least 15 pounds of candy in the house?! this is all just a recipe for me to fail at my diet.  Seriously fail.  And my weight has plateaued which sucks and makes me not want to fail, but it is Halloween and I'm on my period and chocolate--I'm probably going to fail so let's just try to not FAIL and just fail.

So, I chose a 70 calorie kitkat over an 80 calorie snickers or a 110 calorie reeses cup.

I forgot that kitkats weren't gluten free because the last chocolate covered wafer thing I ate was.

I have celiac disease.

Now I feel like the life is being drained from me.  I am nauseous and getting this stabbing pain in my upper right back which is referred pain from my intestines.  That was the clue that something was amiss.  That stabbing pain.

I still have to carve a pumpkin.  I have other things I have to do today but I can't think of them right now.

FUCK! I have to go for a run and I still have to go trick or treating later.  

I hope I don't shit myself later.

Fucking gluten-vampire kitkat stabbing me in the back over and over.

At least you were delicious you little fucker.  :(
