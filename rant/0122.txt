Fuck you Steam &gt;:l

Far Cry 3, Fall Out New Vegas, The Hunter and Goat Simulator.

These are the few of the many games that do not work on my computer.
Every other game works just fine, if my brother twiddles with it for atleast an hour for it to work. All the other games of the said above do not work and there is nothing about it on the steam support or from the steam officials. Maybe its just my hump of shit computer (probably is), but even then. That doesn't stop me from being unbelieveably pissed off when I spend atleast 5 hours downloading a game just for it to tell me "Error -4253382828283828328382838283291937592, re-installing might help!" Every night I play the same old games and when I go "Hey thats on sale... lets try that!" buy it, download it and it doesn't fucking work. I'm sorry but if I give you money just for you to turn around and say "I dunno, re-install it" while counting my pennies then I don't know what good service is. Conclusion is that I quite enjoy steam, love the community and I love the games (that work) But for christ sake, I was basically praying for New Vegas to work even before I hit the download button ;_;
