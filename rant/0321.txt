Why is tipping still a thing?

I've never really understood the concept of tipping.  I'm supposed to add 15% more onto my bill  just to pad your wallet for doing your job?  Is it really that hard to move food not even prepared by you from point a to point b?  It's not my job to pay your salary, that's your employers job.

You knew when you took that job and what it pays.  If it won't keep you in the lifestyle you are accustomed don't expect me to shell out more.  You might as well be out on the side of the road with a bucket and a sign asking for money.

And before anyone tells never to walk a mile in their shoes I have.  I worked shitty fast food jobs all through high school and college.  I never complained about tips nor did I ever do anything disgusting to ppls food who didn't tip.  That is one of the things that gave me motivation to stay in school so I wouldn't wind up working a job like that for tips my whole life.
