How stupid are people.

One of my In-laws just posted a picture with their son, all decked out in their halloween costumes, with the caption "Getting ready to trik-and-treat". Exact quote...And not to mention it's a week before halloween. 

I wonder how long it's going to take them to realize no one else is out in costumes asking for candy.

I mean, I knew they weren't the smartest people in the world. These people refuse to believe the word "little" is not spelled and pronounced "lil".
