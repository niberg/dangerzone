Seriously dude, just fuck off out of my room

I sit in my room all day to not be near you. Yes you're my roommate, but that doesn't mean we have to spend every single fucking moment together. And now because the cats have taken to sleeping in my room during the day, you somehow think that's an open invitation to just fucking walk in here whenever you feel like.

You're not even interesting. Which is the worst part. If you were as annoying as you are, but you actually told me interesting things when you came in here, I'd not mind so much. But no, you come in, telling me what you're spending your money on, or what your mummy is buying you, or some random fact I'd be able to google if I gave a fuck about the subject. How do you not get the hint from my obvious disinterested grunts and groans.

Just fuck off and leave me alone, you annoying dickhead.
