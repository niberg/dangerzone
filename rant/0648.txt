Damn barking dogs

This has become an epidemic in my neighborhood. I'm so sick and tired of listening to the constant bellowing/howling/yapping of everyone's god damn dogs. I stand in my yard and for as far as you can hear and in every possible direction, incessant barking and NO ONE seems to care! This is a very nice HOA controlled community. I just don't get it, calls to the HOA are ignored and the city wont do anything about it unless you want to group up with several neighbors to take the owner to court! Yeah good luck with that. It can drive a person nuts. The worst part is these idiots next door figured it would be a good idea to buy 2 large breed dogs and install them in the back yard permanently. Not a single minute do they interact with them or walk them. Twice a day a hand comes out the back door to dump food into a bowl and that is the extent of the relationship. They just sit there in that yard year after year and bark non stop most likely from the soul crushing boredom. I suspect the same with most everyone else around here. Why the fuck would you get a dog and leave it outside 24/7/365 with nothing to do but bark at everything? People suck so bad. The neighborhood sounds like one giant dog pound and I cannot for the life of me understand how no one seems to mind this. There must be others out there that have this issue. I thought about moving but I don't know who in their right mind would want to move in here with this noise.
