My Corsair water cooler system is a facking hard drive seek sounding whore

I've had this corsair water cooler thing for a few years.  It's not been asked to do much but sit there and not be whorebag.  Its done it's minimal thing, which is cool the cpu by pumping water around internally.  It's been fine except recently it's been making these hard-drive seeking noises, constantly.  I keep thinking that some asshacker is asshacking my hard drives.

But then I remembered, I have SSDs and no moving hard drive parts anymore.  So...what's with this noise?  When it first happened I was *seriously freaked out* because the noise is exactly the same noise as someone doing hardcore read operations on the drive.

So I'm in a constant state of needless paranoia with this little shit.  I want to rip it out but I can't afford to right now.  I'm having to deal with a once-quiet system now being a little jerk.

Thanks for hearing my rant.  I want to pee on it sometime.  I don't know why pee.  Just seems right.
