When women say its just as hard to get a good body as it is for men

I saw this post where women were once again trying to claim they have it harder (no surprise) by saying "omg its just as hard for women because its easier for guys to lose weight and we are judged more and blah blah blah" First off, just because you lose weight as a guy doesnt mean you look ideal yet. The ideal body type is muscular and it takes years especially for me to build that mass. I am underweight and I have been getting shit for it my whole life. Obveously I am not the ideal body type. I would be if I was a woman but I have to go the extra mile and get muscle mass on top of that which I have been trying to do for years. Yet some women can say "omg 8 months till I go to the beach! Ill be ready by then!" I don't know a guy on earth who could say that unless they have put atleast 8 months of work on it from the beginning in the first place.
I thought this was common sense, women lose weight, guys lose it and then work on muscle. If you are already skinny then women do nothing but tone it out, while in my case I spend years working out with little results. Its fucking harder. Common damn sense
