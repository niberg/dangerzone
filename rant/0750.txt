Religion has no fucking place in politics, government, or social policy.

It is fucking disgusting that politicans can use their religion to make policy decisions that affect me.

Your nonsensical magical fairytales are fine for them to believe in the comfort of their own home. But when they take office, and start making policy decisions based on religious beliefs, I wish I could take a shit on their face. 

The biggest issue affected by this is gay marriage. The idea that marriage is a sacred thing comes SOLELY from historical and contemporary religious beliefs. There is NO good reason for gay marriage to be illegal, save religious misgivings.

AND RELIGION HAS NO PLACE IN GOVERNMENT, POLITICS, SOCIAL POLICY. HOW THE FUCK CAN SO MANY FUCKING MORONS AROUND THE WORLD NOT GET THIS?
