Such a shit parent

How the fuck do you tell a *child* that thunder is planets slamming together and you need to be careful because one can hit earth? Now she's terrified and NOTHING I say can change that! 

You've done a lot of shit things in her life and this is far from the worst but why the fuck would you say this?! Ugh, I officially hate that you still breathe.
