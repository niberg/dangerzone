Who the hell dares to muzzle my dog!

I am freaking furious right now! I had just gotten home from a relaxing day and I get home and see my poor Australian shepherd muzzled with a collar. He doesn't wear collars because he hates them. So someone got a collar and muzzled him. I flip my shit! How in the world and why would someone do this. I yelled at the top of my lungs "who ever the hell is touching my dog ima beat there fucking ass" and I kno I'm being a little dramatic here but fuck it im angry I hope they get muzzled and see how it feels &gt;=[
