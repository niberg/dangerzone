It's not fucking sad to see two people in a restaurant, both on their cell phones!

I get this shit all the time.  "Ohhh, they must not love each other enough... *HOW SAD* that they can't even communicate!?"

Hey, when you spend 80% of your life with someone for over 7 years, you've told all the current stories, you've hashed out all the disagreements, and you've said all the pertinent things.  What you're waiting for is a NEW story or a NEW experience to come along.  New experiences don't happen while waiting for food, except in rare occasions.  So, do you stare off into space uncomfortably, trying to think of SOMETHING you haven't yet talked about with your SO?  No, you get on your phone, and your SO does too, and hey guess what, that gives you new things to bring up!

But nooo, that's not good enough for some people, is it?  What are we supposed to do, "gaze longingly into each other's eyes" until the food arrives?  Make silly faces?

Dammit, someone erase my memory so I can treat every dinner outing as a first date so I don't get those sad looks while entertaining myself with my phone for ten minutes before the food arrives.
