Fucking cancer awareness.

Who wastes money on this shit? Everyone knows someone who had cancer. The problem is not getting people to crawl out from under fucking rock and have some sort of magical HOLY SHIT, CANCER EXISTS epiphone! The thing with cancer is we haven't quite cured it yet. People seem to get all pissy and pull their tampons out and toss them at the broad side of my skull whenever I remind them EVERYONE FUCKING KNOWS BREAST CANCER IS A THING.
