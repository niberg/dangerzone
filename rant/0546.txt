Fuck you nameless coworker

God, how are people so fucking petty! I worked 12 hour days everyday for 8 days straight, sorry I couldn't be upbeat when I met you. I had to save all my energy for our non existent customers. You're right to be annoyed if I was too competitive on the sales floor, but it's fucking sales! I want to sell, I want a lease on a nice car, I want to visit my friend in Williamsburg Va, I want to save for college, I want to travel to an exotic country! So yea I'm competitive and "sharky"! If you can't handle that don't work at a high end goods store. Seriously, I'm here to sell shit, so the store does well, and I do well. If you want to make sales be sharper than me. I'm not an asshole I won't sweep the rug under your feet. But hey half the people who give me shit do the same thing, I asked you to tell the customer the product looked nice to back me up, not talk to my customers for 7 hours and steal the sale. People like me exist, we want money to fund our projects, to enjoy life, this sales job despite how well paying isn't my end all, but you'll be damned before I don't do everything in my ability to ensure this jobs means something, whether it's experience or monetary gain. Okay and now I'm ready to act all happy around my insufferable, dimwitted coworkers
