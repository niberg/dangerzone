Goddamnit Apple!

EVERY FUCKING TIME my MacBook breaks down, I need to use a Windows computer to fix it. This shit pisses me the fuck off. I won't be able to get to a Windows computer until tomorrow and then it'll take a few hours to fix before I can get back to work again. WHAT THE FUCK, APPLE. I shouldn't need a Windows computer to fix Mac issues.
