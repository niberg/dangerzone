42y/o man child, er, husband for sale. Comes with trovi infected computer.

Husband finally upgraded to windows 7 from XP last week. Spent a ridiculous amount of time (read: days) backing up files and even programs on an external hard drive, then proceeds to upgrade from xp 32 bit to win7 64 bit. Used some kind of file transfer wizard... Surprise, none of the programs will run, therefore files won't open. Did I tell him this would happen? Yes. Did I tell him that is was completely unnecessary to transfer the programs because they need to be reinstalled? Yes. Did he waste hours doing it anyway? YES! 

So now, man child has been painstakingly reinstalling all his little random programs that he doesn't even need. Lots of freeware, lots of bullshit. Lots of "hey, I'm a dumbass so I'll just let it do the recommended install instead of choosing custom so I don't have to fuck with all the stupid toolbars and add-ons". Of course, now he's got this stupid trovi pup because stupid random programs were more important than downloading the updates for the 2yr old antivirus program he installed from a disc! 

So, yeah. He's for sale today. Fuck.
