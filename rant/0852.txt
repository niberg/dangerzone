Listen for the doorbell when you order a fucking pizza

The amount of people that order a pizza then don't pay attention for the doorbell or knocking astounds me. I delivered a couple pizzas to a guy's house. It was my last delivery and I wanted to go home. I go up to the door and knock. No answer. I ring the doorbell. No answer. I wait a minute and try the doorbell again. Still no answer. At this point I'm thinking "Fuck, maybe I have the wrong house." Check the receipt and the house number. It's the right house. I call the phone number that guy gave to us. Guess what? No fucking answer. I leave a message, though. I called my manager and tell him whats up. Guy isn't answering the door or my phone calls. He tells me to wait a few minutes and try again. So I do. It's now been about 10 minutes since I first arrived at the guys house. I try knocking and ringing and knocking and ringing again and again. Of course, there's no answer. I call his phone again and I leave another message. I call my manager again and tell him I'm just going to leave, because the guy obviously isn't home. Manager tells me to hold on for just another minute and he will try calling the guy. So he does. Guess what? The guys finally fucking answers his phone! My manager calls me back and tells me the guy is coming out to meet me, just as I notice the front door is opening. I get the guy's pizzas out of my car and walk up towards him. Want to know the first thing he said to me? " Why didn't you ring the doorbell?" I tell him I did. A few times. He says "Oh, must have had the TV up too loud." I've never wanted to punch somebody in the face more than in that moment.
