Well it's all over now

Yes I know that everyone in our group of friends has liked her. Yes I know they all have dated her except me. Sorry I've never had a girlfriend. Sorry I can't talk to girls without getting super awkward. I'm fucking sorry that I fell in love with the one girl that ever actually cared about me at all. I'm sorry that I poured my entire heart and soul into asking her to homecoming EVEN AS A FUCKING FRIEND BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO DAMAGE OUR FRIENDSHIP. I'm sorry I'll never feel this way about a girl ever again. I'm sorry she's leaving next year and none of us will ever see her again so this is my last chance to ever have this opportunity. i didn't ask her so I could be the center of attention. I didn't ask anyone else because I don't care about girls like that. IM SORRY THAT THE ONLY OTHER GIRL NEVER SPOKE TO ME AGAIN. I'm sorry that you won't either now. I'm sorry that in trying not to hurt me, you did; severely and beyond repair. And finally, I'm sorry to my future self that because of all this built up scarring and emotions I'll never stick my neck out again in this way because I don't want to get my heart broken another time.
