To the asshole who wanted to suck my dick.

Alright I don't really consider myself an attractive man, but this 2nd fucking time I've had a older gay guy creep up on me. 

1. Dude if you gonna ask me to suck my dick, don't do it at a stoplight at an intersection.

2. Don't fucking honk at me to get my fucking attention.

3. Seriously, I was trying to fucking listen to NPR. Yeah I listen to it from time to time. I'm not smart I just like listening to current events about horrible shit done to people in countries with names I cannot spell. I dunno liberal guilt, whatever. 

4. Was it because I was listening to NPR. When the fuck did NPR = ghey?

4. Seriously fuck you. 

5. Why can't girls to this to me.

I'm offended, but slightly flattered, but mostly offended. And as an adult, I should be letting this go, but fuck you.
