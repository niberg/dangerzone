The Absurdity of Bureaucracy in Schools

So, I teach in an Alternative environment. We have extremely small class sizes, and by extremely small, I mean that I have one kid for science in the morning. I was always taught that when you are alone with a kid to leave the door open. That way, it will be harder for someone to claim that you were doing anything inappropriate with the kid. It would be rather ballsy to attempt anything like that with the door slam wide open.  

However, I have just been told off for keeping the door open because the safety policy says it needs to be shut. I wouldn't mind it as much if it was because of fire codes or something. No, it's because if some lunatic with 50 million guns rushes into the building, we will be sitting ducks. I mean really!? Honestly, even with the door shut there are two giant windows leading to outside and the hallway. If someone wanted to shoot us, we'd be dead with the door shut anyways! Also, isn't it far more likely that a sexual harassment suit to come before the county than for some intruder to storm into the building? 

ARGH I swear to god-!
