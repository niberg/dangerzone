That one guy in the comments

So I've been on reddit not terribly long, and I've found a pattern. On just about every other post, mine or otherwise, there's a guy in the comments. He contributes nothing but a 'fuck you OP go die' or similar. I got curious and clicked on his name, recognizing it from other rude and similar things. Turns out he does nothing but this, insulting and slandering. I can't report him, how do you report a troll or (more likely) a throwaway account? He just keeps doing it, and the shit thing is apparently we like the same subreddits. So anything I read or say, there he is. I go from excited I found this website to dread of this asshole. Why do people have to do that? What bullshit existence is it to live to make everyone miserable all the time? Ugh.
