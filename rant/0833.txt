The Subway I work at

I used to manage a Subway, but when I got a better job, I quit being a manager and now just work 6-12 hours a day. We have a new general manager, a new store manager, and: woah. Where to start? 

Two months ago an employee who is 17 was struck by the 50-something store manager in the back of neck. He panicked and left, and two employees said they were quitting when the general manager fired the kid and didn't discipline the store manager. General manager responded by texting her 130-or-so employees that "if anyone threatens to quit over this: I will make your next job impossible to get." 

So that's what we call Neck-slap-gate. 

Next I'll do a lighting round of how they cut corners as far as cleanliness and sanitation: 

* The roast beef and pastrami are old as shit, and we're told to relabel them every day so they appear "fresh." 

* When we run out of dish sopa or sanitizer, instead of buying some generic stuff from the store, we're instructed to just use water. 

* *Every* item on our cold-wells are above 45 degrees 

* We haven't had hot water for about a month

* We use and sell rotted tomatoes, and we have tricks to "fake-ripen" avocados that are really hard and woody 

* We are so understaffed that no one takes sick days. It's a running joke that you can only get time off if it's related to "picking up my kids." One of our closers was throwing up one night, and waS told he "needs to take better care of himself," when he asked management if someone could cover his shift, instead of telling him no one's available *because we are so understaffed.* 

That brings me to today. Last night I broke a rib in my jiu jitsu class, went to the ER, and told my manager that I can't come into today. It's been months since I even entertained the audacity of calling in sick or injured, but breathing hurts like a mother fucker right now, so I figured I was good. 

Nah, shit management texted me "Sounds suspicious.. can u send a pic of xray?" 

Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em so much. Fuck them for telling an overwate employee she can't wear leggings when every girl wears leggings. Fuck them for shielding a 40-year-old employee who does coke and a sleuth of uppers at work. Fuck them for taking an employee off the payroll after he was gone for six days following the death of his best friend. Fuck them for cutting everyone's hours except for the store manager and her husband, who maintain 38-41 hours each. Go fucking figure. 

They suck. They are not good. I hate them and wish they stub their toe every ten minutes for the rest of their life.
