Overused phrases

For example:

* Lack thereof
* Social pariah
* Drunken stupor
* In this day and age

I know there are more but none in particular come to mind. I can't fucking stand when people say these phrases. I swear to goddamn Christ the next time I hear anybody say any one of the aforementioned phrases I am going to blow a fucking gasket. Just think of a different way to say it! It's not difficult!
