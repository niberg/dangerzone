I have no clue what to do..

My life is turning upside down,I'm 20, I don't have many friends, my parents have been going through a rough divorce, mom is an alcoholic, mentally abusive, and money hungry. I live with my dad but he is moving to Pennsylvania to be with his new girlfriend,  but I decided to stay here in Washington state, and try to live on my own,  but I only have a part time job, looking for full time, have bills out the ass from car payments to cell phone bill, I honestly don't know what to do, I've been thrown into an ocean and I'm drowning...
