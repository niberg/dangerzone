Can't get 3DS Promotion Cause of Ebay

I know it doesn't sound that bad bit I'm still fairly mad about it
I bought my 3DS XL back in June and was going to register it so i can get the free game promotion for club Nintendo. Problem is my 3DS XL didn't come with a PIN code at all. Worse, when I tried to find evidence showing i bought a new one, Ebay decides to forget that I bought it and it doesn't show up in my purchase history.
