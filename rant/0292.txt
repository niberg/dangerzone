Pride

Being proud about youself over things you had no control over is so fucking dumb. Race, nationalty, sexual preferene, age, things you like.

I love reading, I'm not proud that I read, I just think reading is awesome.

How about giving that emotion of self indulgence to something that you actually earned and worked for rather than dropping it every time someone criticizes who you are.
