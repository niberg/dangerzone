A Veteran in need of help...

For the past 12 years, I served my country with honor and distinction in the Army as an Officer and Infantryman... it's all I know. Transitioning into a civilian has been one of the hardest things I've ever done and I've wanted to give up. I'm just another person just trying to make it and it's so damn hard. I haven't been able to maintain a healthy relationship because I struggle to control my emotions; so many people have been coming in and out of my life over the past year. About a month ago I met a woman and she has been an absolute godsend. The one woman I felt truly understood me and whose touched calmed me down.

Tonight we had a great evening together and she decided to stay over. Her warmth quickly put me to sleep, which is something I struggle to do alone. About an hour ago I woke up violently from a recurring nightmare that startled and scared her. She quickly gathered her belongings and left... another person to leave me.

I just want to feel normal... I just want someone to love me.
