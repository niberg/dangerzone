I went to the mental hospital at the same time as a girl who bullied me.

I came out of inpatient after five days, a bit early because I didn't want to lose my job. Upon my release I have gotten one concerned e-mail, and one long touching talk with my dad. I wanted to open up a tad bit on Facebook about it, but if I post about being depressed, no one comments. Even if I post about trying to be positive, no one comments. I ended up losing my job anyhow, by the way.

Meanwhile this girl that bullied me just came out after three days in a mental hospital and has gotten people watching over her constantly, dozens of Facebook upvotes on every depressed message she posts. Some of her biggest supporters have been friends of mine, who know all about this bullying. I haven't gotten any messages from anyone.

People claim to care about suicidal people, but it all feels like a pathetic popularity contest. It's just not fair, and I don't know if I can take this kind of crap anymore.
