That's all there is to it I guess.

I've been wondering lately; is that all there is to life? It feels like every good thing is just a pale compensation for every 9 other bad things that are going to come. Every single aspect of my daily routine is boring. Sometimes I feel like the only times I actually feel anything is when I have to go to the bathroom, and that's not a very pleasant feeling. Well, at least it's a feeling I guess.
Studies, work, other stupid pointless stuff, more studies, more work, then sleep. What am I even doing all of this for? To be able to almost enjoy half of my life in 20 years? But even for that there's a pretty small chance. I've tried writing, I've tried reading, I've tried losing weight, putting on muscles, singing, drawing, creating art, math, calculus, chemistry, physics, psychology and everything else. There's just no point to anything. I can't recall the last time I've felt passionate about something, be it another person, music, food or bloody anything. The only refreshing thing I've done recently is plotting my suicide and pretty much telling everybody how much I love them, just in case.
I don't want to die, I don't want to live. I don't want anything. I just want to not exist, so I don't have to deal with any of this.
