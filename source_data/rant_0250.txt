I've finally concluded this site is another stupid piece of crap.

[Really?] (http://imgur.com/3Sk1Jvr) [Fucking Really!?] (http://imgur.com/3Sk1Jvr) This makes a front page? This [shit] (http://imgur.com/3Sk1Jvr)?

Now I don't think my submissions are the next big thing in literature, but I'm confident it's better than A FUCKING DISHWASHER! How fucking stupid are you people? Art is posted here on a regular basis and the shit that makes the front page is boobs, celebrities and fucking mundane shit i.e memes and cats. 

I always thought what I submitted was just subpar crap, and that was the reason why it never got anywhere. But the fact you upvote a picture of a bourgeois object, something in almost every damn kitchen, makes me wonder if popularity is determined by a bunch of fucking idiots.

Maybe I'm just pissed about getting ignored in general, friends been too busy to help in the slightest with film making, posts getting buried every time and having job applications turned down constantly. Okay I don't have a degree, I'm working on it, but I need a job to be independent- to pay for that degree- so just tell what you fucking want and if you don't know what you want- FUCKING TAKE ME!

The point is I'm done. I'm done with this internet crap, I'm done with being ignored. The internet isn't some fantastic world, it just another shit hole filled with scams and false promises.
