Please just repeat the part I didn't hear.

YOU: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so be sure to [part I didn't hear].  

ME: I'm sorry, "so be sure to..." what?  

YOU: I said "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so be sure to + [part I didn't hear]."  

Please pay attention. I only needed you to repeat the specific part I didn't hear. That's why I phrased the question the way I did instead of just saying "what?" or saying "I'm sorry I didn't hear any of that - please repeat all of what you just said".
