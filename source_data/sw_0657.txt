36 and tired of fighting

Really, I'm just trying to decide if it is better to disappear and die privately or just get it over with in my own bed. I have decided on April of 2015. Pressing obligations will be over, no holidays are in April, and no friends or family have April birthdays.
I moved 2000 miles away from a rather dysfunctional family as soon as I got my BS degree 9 years ago. Things were bad there and going back is just not an option. I've had my share of struggles out here, but things have been very bad since 2011. I found my best friend dead due to suicide, lost several other people close to me, had the man I lost my virginity to (at 32) that I thought I would spend the rest of my life with dump me, both my elderly pets died within months of each other...and now I live in what used to be the office of a motel. It is a rat trap at best.
I'm simply tired of fighting. I think of death daily. It isn't enough anymore to stay alive to prevent those who love me and that I love from suffering pain.
I just want to know if it'd be easier for them if I disappear so they can still hold on to hope I'm alive somewhere or if it'd bring them more peace to have a body to bury.
