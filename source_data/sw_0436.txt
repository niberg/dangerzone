Still not good

I've been shoving a lot of shit down. Pretending like it's ok because it easier. I still want to check the fuck out. As soon as Im done tomorrow, there is nothing to stick around for. 

I have a lot. I just don't feel like i belong. Like i shouldnt be here. Like I'm not like the rest of you though I desperately want to be. Like I'm loveable but not loveable all at the same time. 

I just don't belong here. I just don't belong...
