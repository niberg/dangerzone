x-post from /r/care : Guy I've played video games with for years is suicidal

Hey all... don't wanna get too specific but a guy I've been playing video games online with for like 7 years on and off unloaded on me recently that he's basically been in a really shitty spot. That is, he doesn't know what to do given his circumstances, and already has planned his own death - which he described to me. He said he only told me because I've known him so long and that I've always been there for him. Now to his side of the story... His bro has seizures and is an incredibly jealous guy to boot. My friend is a good guy and lives with him (his bro) to help him out with his medical issues... but his bro is also something of a jealous douche because of his circumstance.

Moral of the story is, my bud gets no support from his parents, feels like a waste of space, and a cog in a machine because he always has to be there with his brother. He's got a lot of life and is great to talk to... but he can't deal with his parents who don't give him any props for helping his bro, and apparently his bro takes advantage and emotionally tilts a lot of the situations because of his circumstance. On top of that, when out at social gatherings, his brother - who has seizures - pretty much sabotages all of my buds attempts of meeting new women with his own problems. It seems like a really shitty situation. I don't know what to do because he's obviously got a suicide plan. I tried messaging related family members after knowing he's suicidal, but the only person I got a hold of was his bro with seizures - and his bro never responded. My friend (who has the suicide issues) actually messaged me saying "Did you message my bro on facebook?" I feel really stuck in this spot - any help would be appreciated.
