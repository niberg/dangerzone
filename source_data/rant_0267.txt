Police can't help with civil matter...

WTF is this if I get caught stealing something or vandalizing a store I will be sent to jail. Apparently though if a person fucking does it to someone else the police have no jurisdiction? Goes to fucking show you who our fucking police force truely works for. It's not fucking us.... FUCK THE JUSTICE SYSTEM and ur fucked up tactics. You want me to go through the bureaucratic system just to see something happen to the person that wronged me. So should cooperations. I guess thats what happens when I don't have enough money to line the higher ups pockets.
