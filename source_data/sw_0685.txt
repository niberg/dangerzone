Unlike most of this sub, I feel like I'm totally rational in my desire to die

My depression isn't directly caused by chemical imbalance but rather real life issues I'm unable to overcome. I have crippling social anxiety and a boring personality that makes it impossible for me to create friendships. At 21, supposedly the prime of my life, I have NO friends or relationships. The loneliness+pent up sexual frustration is excruciating. I've tried every single treatment option (therapy, medication etc.), all have failed. Every year has gotten staggeringly worse. Don't really see the point in sticking around when things will, in all likelihood, get worse.
