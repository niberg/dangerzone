I just want it to end.

I hate my life, I has no meaning. I don't have any real friends, I spend my days in locked in my room. I think about suicide daily, when ever I'm in a social situation I always do the wrong thing. I'm really socially awkward. I can talk to people I'm not shy but It's this weird feeling when I want to talk to someone I don't know what to say. I get made fun of all the time at school, I look at people and wish I could be like them. I can't even talk properly I have a lisp. I hate my family I get emotionally abused daily and used to get phonically abused. The only thing that I always want is drugs, I want to talk to a psychologist I just don't know what to say and what they'll think of me, and if they report me for suicidal thought. I am also not confident in anything I do so when someone makes fun of me it puts me down alot.
