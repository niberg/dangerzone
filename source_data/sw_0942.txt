Iv struggled with suicide for 3 years.

I have attempted suicide twice. I thought things were going ok, my meds got doubled in the summer. But I am back to self harm and increasing interest in hard drugs. and I am debating once again the pros and cons of life and the cons vastly outweigh the pros. I am sinking deeper and deeper, I hope this time I have the brains to succeed rather than rack up another failure.
