Worried about an acquaintance

There's a woman who a coworker and I met on a train a few weeks ago. This week she has been talking about suicide, and not wanting to deal with cancer for a fourth time. Partly financial issues, but partially not I think. I don't know what I can do or say to try to prevent this from happening, or if that's even appropriate. I barely know her.
