I did everything I thought I was supposed to do.

I walked forward because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. I graduated HS, I graduated from college, can't find a job I don't hate, wonder what the purpose of it all was. What did I bother for? I wonder if I ever didn't hate people, if I wasn't so mean, or maybe I'm just that way. Maybe I've become rotten from the inside out, and I've built this armor around me that will eventually suffocate me.

Nobody's anecdotes ever really phase me, because I don't think it will ever happen to me, because it never happens to me, and I wonder why I've wasted my time, wasted everyone else's time. At the end of the day, I hate myself I suppose. I don't really want to die but I have no real desire to keep living either, especially if I'm faced with the prospect of a life I don't really want.
