"I'll have a caramel macchiato, but with mocha instead of caramel and can you use soy milk?"

Barista here. Its my job to make you drinks, and even when its an annoying, long order like the title; I will happily make it for you. But if you could not ignore me when I ask what you want because you are on the phone with another bimbo talking about how you got sooo drunk last night and landed on a dick; that would be great. You hold up me and the line behind your bubble brained self.

Oh, and after I get done with your 5 minute drink I'd appreciate it if instead of using that annoying 'better than everyone else' voice to say thanks, you try actually meaning it.

Thanks for making my job *this* much more irritating.
