Arrow: More dagum hollywood techno-mumblojumblo

So Felicity Smoak is Green Arrow's gorgeous, fit, adorkable-dream-pixie-uberhacker girl-friday who is able to, like, hack torsecured NSA firewalls in five minutes using a rotating linux algorithm she came up with in the shower one day.

Here is the dialogue from the latest episode, and it hit me worse than building a realtime app using visual basic to track the killers IP:

Felicity: Hi. Thank you for waiting.

Gay Superman: Ah, no problem.  I just want to buy this.

Felicity: This is a satellite frequency communicator TX40. 

Gay Supe: Yeah, I'm trying to breach a torsecured firewall and I need something to help me piggyback off a keyhole hexagon satellite, so...

Felicity: I did that once.  Hacked a public WI-Fi signal, piggybacked using crowd-sourced stealth processing.

Gay Supe: Huh. You're Felicity Smoak.

Also, I had to google for the transcript.  I am an expert in technology and I couldn't understand a f*** thing they were saying because they were swallowing their words rolling out their unconfident technojive.  Now that I know what words they actually said, I think it's somehow even stupider.  

*You can't just wordsalad technology words!* ARRGGH!  I scream thru 7 proxies

Me: I'm going to framework my QA process for a curry algorithm in scrum, then refactor the prototype using a crowdsourced paradigm for social.

Felicity: I did that once when I hacked the NSA for my boyfriend.

Me: hor.
