Sick of being fucking depressed

I'm sick of feeling like shit all the time. When people tell me to just feel happy-it's not a easy thing to do. I can't just flick it on and off. I can't stop myself from feeling like everything I'll do will end up in failure. 

I can't finish my fucking essay that's way passed over due because I keep changing the same paragraph. I have my thoughts out, but I can't put them into words. I try less and less when I reread what I'm writing. It fucking sucks. I keep reusing certain transition words, there's no flow to it, I can't connect all my thoughts together, I chose a terrible example that I can't replace, my movie doesn't go very well with the prompt, there's other shit to do too.

I can't draw. I look at what I'm doing and i feel discouraged. I do want art to be my future but I won't be able to if I don't keep drawing. Sometimes I'll get in the mood to draw but it'll never meet my expectations. I keep disappointing myself.

And then there's my love life. Which is just fantastic. Just about everything I do, it makes it worse. I constantly think about losing him. I don't have anything interesting or funny to say, I can't have a regular conversation with him. I can't see him whenever I please because he's half way across the country. With all these shitty feelings, there's nothing else I want to do but be held and be told everything is going to be okay. I want to be taken care of. I want to be weak and have him tell me things are going to be okay. I want to him to tell me he loves me, as needy and whiney as it sounds. 

I can't keep my shit together, I'm falling behind on classes, I'm losing my will to draw, I'm screwing up my relationship.

I don't want to be told or reminded that everything is my fault. I want someone to lie to me, just tell me that things are going to be okay-even if they won't. 

I wish there was a easier and less pettier way of saying "I'm lonely and sad, please talk with me."
