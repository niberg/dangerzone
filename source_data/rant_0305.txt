Rant about AT&amp;T and Apple.

I ordered my Iphone 6 on the 7th. I was already frustrated because AT&amp;T's damn commercial said "Yes, we have the Iphone 6 **IN STOCK**", but when I went to the AT&amp;T store they told me a different story. Apparently **NO** AT&amp;T store had it in stock.

So I thought to myself okay no problem I'm in no rush, I'll just order by phone and it will ship in 3-5 days or so. NOPE after I tell the very hard to communicate with guy all the details of the order he tells me it will be shipped in about 3 weeks. At this point I really didn't want to wait this long, but I was already all in so I thought "what the hell I can wait."

Now anxious about my purchase I talk to other impatient AT&amp;T customers about their waiting experience and all the ones I talked to said their's were shipped a lot earlier than expected and I gained a newfound hope that my Iphone 6 would arrive quickly.

Boy was I wrong! I ordered my Iphone on the 7th of October and they still haven't even started shipping it yet! Everyday since the 27th which was the first estimated shipping date I've looked at the "Order Status Summary" on their website and still nothing! It says "Preparing to Ship" and there is NO tracking number (obviously because it hasn't begun shipping yet).

So what the hell AT&amp;T and Apple! Why the hell didn't Apple make more phones and why did AT&amp;T falsely advertise that they had Iphone 6's in stock!?

TL;DR
Screw Apple and AT&amp;T for taking so damn long to not even begin to ship my Iphone 6. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous price for a product that comes with such shitty customer service.
