My roommate just fucking emptied out his chip crumbs ON THE FLOOR

He finished his chips, upended the bag and "made it rain" on the dog. I told him "please stop, this is why we have mice" he said it didn't matter because we already had mice.

WHAT THE FUCK IS HIS PROBLEM????

He eventually admitted he shouldn't do that, but it was worth it because it was funny and said that dog would eat the crumbs.
