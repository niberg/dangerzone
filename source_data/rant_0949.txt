Why is it so ironic and bad to express feelings on the internet?

I've had enough of it, I just want to get angry at the fact that when people piss you off you can't tell them to fuck off. Especially when working together. It also annoys me the fact that the news treats social media like its the fucking exact thing they are talking about. No it fucking isn't it's just a way to express feelings. 

My college is a fucking loud mouth, he sits on facebook all day playing war commander and listening to some random youtubers chatting shit when playing games. It fucks me off that I'm working and he's not. Admittedly we're allowed some personal browsing etc. etc. but fuck me he's on this constantly. It really annoys me when my boss complains that his workload is to much and yet he compromises it as "unquantifiable" because you can't mesure how much time needs to be spent on each issue. Well whoopdy fucking doo... I get through at least 80 calls a month and he sits there at a shitty 30 and gets paid TWICE as much. What the fuck do you do prick and why do you not accept that I do things completely differently to you? 

Seriously, piss off.
