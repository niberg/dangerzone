Kid who didn't work on project at all.

There's this new kid in my senior class and I've been recently shooting the shit with him during class and kinda getting to know him. He seemed alright until we had a group project to do and he hasn't done one fucking thing on it. I thought I was going to be nice and spare him from having to be in a group where he would be uncomfortable and felt unwanted but apparently he was just using me so I could do all the work. Fuck him, next time he wants a partner, I'm telling him to fuck off.
