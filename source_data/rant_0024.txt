Oh, you're the customer?

You are the rudest, trashiest customer I've had the pleasure of talking to. I had a note on my desk to give you a call back to take care of an issue with an item that had been ordered since the original person has been out all week. I regret ever giving you a call. I asked you what item did you receive since I assumed it was different from the order information. Oh no. You received the correct item but you say that's not what you ordered and the order information is wrong. I told you to request a return authorization so you can return the item. You refused. I asked you what item did you intend to order. You refused once again. I guess you could sense the frustration in my voice and said don't get huffy and puffy and that you're the customer. 

Oh, you're the customer? Since when did being the customer mean being a complete fucking bitch to someone who is trying to help you? I realize there's this attitude that the customer is always right but you were being completely ridiculous. You then proceeded to tell me to go change my maxi pad and hung up after I stated that I was just trying to help fix the situation. GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU STUPID FUCKING CUNT ASS BITCH!!!! I GUARANTEE YOU ARE NOTHING BUT AN OBESE WHITE PIECE OF TRASH THAT ONLY GETS OFF THE COUCH FOR A BOX OF TWINKIES AND A MOUNTAIN DEW!!! That and I looked up your name on the internet. Got the obese white piece of trash part correct. Go fall off a cliff and die.

I am so tired of being professional and courteous to customers only to receive this type of shit. Customer service isn't primarily my job and I will forever be thankful. I'm the person that makes phone calls and tries to take care of things even when I'm off the clock. But they don't see that. They see what they assume and I'm sick of it.
