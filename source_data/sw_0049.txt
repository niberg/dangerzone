It doesn't feel normal when I'm happy + other issues

On and off for three years I've been dipping in and out of depression since I was 11 and I didn't know what to do until last month (October 23) that I said to my best friend I was planning to kill myself the weekend that followed. She told her councillor who alerted the Child Protection Group at school who phoned my mom, and so she and my dad knew. It was very overwhelming for a while and I didn't know how to react since everyone who knew, including my social worker, were very overprotective for obvious reasons. 

Okay, back to my point. Whenever I have bursts of happiness, it doesn't feel right. Like it's not normal and I always find myself wishing I was sad again, and sooner or later I am. The depression will kick back in like worms surfacing through a tunnel to the surface. I don't know what to do? It could be mood swings or something else. I don't know. 

And also, apparently I've been planned to see a school councillor each week (once a week) yet I haven't. He hasn't asked me or told me when a session is or when he's available, just nothing. I'm not bothered if I can't see him for a while, what bothers me is that he's not telling me anything at all. When I see him through school (e.g. walking past in corridors) he doesn't mention to stop me and tell me. It's like, the school are so concerned yet they're not doing anything. 

I may sound impatient, but what I'm saying is if he can't see me yet then he should tell me. I hardly get a chance to ask him. What do I do now?
