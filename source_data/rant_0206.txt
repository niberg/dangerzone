Went into surgery to have testicle removed due to damage over the years. SO calls me selfish.

Who the fuck in their right mind blames someone for having a surgery? At the end of my fucking tether. Does anyone else think that it's complete fucking bullshit to be blamed? She literally shouted at me for 4 hours while I was laying in bed with my hands down my trousers feeling vulnerable(How generic of a guy) And she comes in like a shitstorm calling me a selfish cunt and how I don't deserve the time I get with her. The fuck have I done wrong?!
