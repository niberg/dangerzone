The one time I don't want to stay home. And you made me. Bitch move.

I really enjoy going to school, I get to see my crush, I get to talk to my friends, play Yu-Gi-Oh, my teachers are cool, it's actually fun.

On Wednesday's (today) I have anime club, something I look forward to a lot.

And specifically on this day on top of all that. I have PSAT (Pre-SAT).

And I told my mom this multiple times. That I can't afford to and don't want to stay home. 

We just hit a financial snag and they (parents) need $900 so they're going to get it pulled from a bank account that my grandma left me when she passed away, and give me the last $100 in it, then pay me back.

But here's where my problem begins

I have problems waking up in the morning, so usually about 5:10 my mom wakes me up if my alarm didn't. Today I woke up at 6:15, 5 minutes before my bus comes, meaning I have literally no time to make it (6 minute walk, but I still have to get dressed, shower, clean my lip ring, pack my backpack).

I go to talk to my mom and she says "Oh no I'm 'letting' you stay home today" I DON'T WANT TO. YOU'RE NOT "LETTING" ME BECAUSE I NEVER ASKED, NEVER LED ON TO, NEVER WANTED TO. IT'S YOUR WAY OF FORCING ME TO STAY. HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO TELL YOU FOR MY OWN SAKE.

I expressed that I didn't want to stay home multiple times, and you STILL DIDN'T WAKE ME UP AND THEN SAY YOU'RE "LETTING" ME STAY HOME!? I HAVE NO REASON TO STAY, I DIDN'T WANT TO STAY SO YOU'RE PRACTICALLY FORCING ME TO BY SCREWING OVER MY MORNING.

I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL. 

I can't wait to get my damn license so my car can finally be put to use.
