Future looks hopeless, only couple months left

Background:
I'm a truck driver from Finland who has to renew multiple licenses such as CE driving license, ADR, CDL-like license (Do not know a proper term for that) the requirement for such requires healthy papers from doctor checkup. 5 years ago had no trouble passing through. But now the condition has gone worse. Paranoid schizophrenia has been diagnosed and that will be a big no for passing through the checkup with clean papers, this leads to not being able to renew the required licenses. And then the only job i am qualified to do is lost.
Already lost a permanent home and i dont see a way out of this hell. So why not make it easy on the state and reduce the amount of workless people on this economically fucked up country they would have to support. I have just about month and 20 days before the licenses expire.
