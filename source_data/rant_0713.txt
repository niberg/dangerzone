Fuck, Steam...! Can't I just play my game without updating it?!

I've been playing Shadow of Mordor and it's been working fine. After a long day of work I'd like to just come home, sit, and play for an hour before bed.

But no. It has to update. And it wants 35 minutes to fucking update it. C'mon, man! Game has been running fine! Fuck your updates, let me play!
