I don't belong. My list of faults is too long. I've been struggling not to take a handful of sleeping pills today.

I don't belong in this world. I feel like I fit in with no one. Even the one 'friend' I have has pointed out that I seem to attract assholes, all the while claiming she has never encountered such treatment by random others, ever.

- My dad was struck by lightning when I was 4 months old.

- My mother tried to raise me as a Jehovah's Witness.

- I was bullied/teased without a single friend in school from 5th to 9th grade, failed 9th grade because of the emotional torture, and dropped out at 16.

- I'm bipolar/manic depressive, severely social phobic, and even religiously taking my medication is not helping. I'm treatment resistant, having tried almost every medicine there is. I'm tired of switching/trying. I'm tired of the visits. I'm just *tired*.

- I lost my daughter due to anger issues and my inability to function. She's with her dad and I can't ever see her again because he doesn't want me to unless I can be 100% consistent 100% of the time, and doesn't want me to tell her I'm transgender or that I have these mental/emotional illnesses.

- I draw disability for a living through social security, and they just told me they overpaid me for 9 months straight and want that money back, and *now*. They're withholding MY ENTIRE CHECK next month just for the cause. And $199 from the following month (January) for the rest of the owed amount.

- My phone company won't work with me at all so I'm losing my phone access on the 20th. So is my boyfriend because our stuff is under my name.

- People say "Oh but you have people who love you." Aside from him I don't feel like it, and I know I'm a heavy burden on him. He sacrificed his relationship with his family, FOREVER, for me. Hasn't spoken to them in years. Nevermind that he certainly didn't sign up for a relationship with a transgender man.

- I HAD a consultation for surgery coming up that WAS making me happy, but it's a done deal now with the finances. It just doesn't seem possible. There's nobody local and the place is 220+ miles away, meaning I need at LEAST $100 in gas alone, plus parking fees, etc. No dice.

- Even if I could fix my finances, I'm so wavering, so unpredictable, so shortsighted, so irresponsible, so self-loathing, so leeching, so self-deprecating, so awkward, so troublesome, so trialsome, so unlucky, so paranoid, so absolutely inconsolable and detrimental to society as an individual that it doesn't even matter.

- I'm too idealistic for this world. I hate humanity sometimes. Not everyone, but for instance organized religion, money in politics, etc. The more I look around me the more I think that I'm just too naive and too idealistic for this world.

- I can't handle reality. I can't handle anything.

- There's no local therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist available to me. My primary care provider, a physician's assistant, is doing his best to accommodate me, but unless I manifest money to pay for someone in the private sector, my options are nil.

- I'm in California, and my family is a hillbilly dysfunctional blob somewhere in the panhandle of Florida. My aunt is a chain-smoking prescription drug addict, my mother is a 65ish year old who also lives off social security and can't do jackshit (I'm 25, for reference), my uncle is married to a woman half his age and they do drugs around their infant/toddler, and the aforementioned uncle/wife live with my 93+ year old grandpa who's going downhill pretty quickly. My grandma died the same year as Steve Irwin, from Alzheimer's because depression deteriorated her. It runs in the family.

- Every time I poke my head out from my shell, someone says or does something so hurtful that I poke it right back in. I don't think I'll ever feel like coming out completely.

This is no life to live. Constantly up, down, up, down, up, down in mood. Wavering from one minute to the next, never knowing how I'll feel one minute, day, hour, second, week, month, year. Never being able to trust even the happiest of times, because it all comes tumbling down horrifically anyways, eventually.

It's been this way since I was little, and it'll be this way until the day I die.

I've been struggling not to take a handful of sleep aids and hope for a coma. I'm not sure why I'm struggling. I'm starting to cry typing this. I'm afraid of death, but I imagine it would be peaceful. So much more peaceful than this.

And I'd rather do just about anything than admit myself to a mental hospital, so that is simply not an option I will accept nor give attention to. Please nobody take that into their own hands.

I don't belong. Not here, not anywhere.

I can't take it anymore.
