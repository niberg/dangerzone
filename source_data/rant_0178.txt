It's minor, but it's annoying as hell.

I go to university in a city that doesn't paint it's curbs in front of fire hydrants, and I happened to park in front of one on trash day. The tennent that put their garbage out, put it in front of the hydrant, and now I have a 40$ fine because I didn't see it. 

I'd never park in front of a hydrant no matter how much of a hurry I was in. Hell I'm in the process of becoming a firefighter right now! Ugh just bitter about the situation. Thanks rantit.
