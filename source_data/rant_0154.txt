Dumb rules for tobacco purchases...

I want to buy loosies at convenience stores instead of being forced to buy 20 packs of cigarettes. Its ridiculous that they'll allow you to buy two packs of cigarillos, which are worse for you than cigarettes, but they won't let you buy anything less than a 20 pack of cigarettes. I've been addicted to smoking for a few years and I've finally started to cut back by not buying packs anymore and only occasionally asking people for cigarettes when I have a craving, but I"m not gonna lie this whole fucking process would be a million times easier if I could just go to a convenience store and buy a goddamn single cigarette (or at the very least like 5 or 10 as opposed to fucking 20). I just wish i lived near one of those mexican bodegas where they sold loosies, but no I live in the middle of suburban nowhere where the black market doesn't exist :( 

EDIT: if it makes any of you guys feel better, I didn't smoke anything today cuz I couldn't find a loosie.
