Bleck. I'm done.

I don't know what to do. The last couple weeks I've been overwhelmingly suicidal. I know I should take my meds but the continuous struggle to afford them is too exhausting. I'm dead inside, and I have nothing left.  I don't want to do it in the house. I don't want to traumatize my room mates. How much time do I put into preparation? Do I clean my room spotless? I don't want people to have to deal with my laundry. What will happen to my cat? I messed this up once, and I don't want to again. If I write out a makeshift will, will it be honored or do I start just distributing my things myself? I don't know. I just need to be done and want to get this moving along.
