Pregnant friend on facebook is really pissing me off.

Today, my friend (whom is 25 and just did in-vitro to have her second child, idefk) posted a status saying her irrational fear is to go into her labor with her hair not done.

First of all, why the fuck is that a fear? Who fucking gives a shit when you're pushing a human being out of your vagina? And second of all, she had TWO miscarriages before this and THAT'S what she's concerning herself with? Seriously?

To make matters worse there are actually fucking people agreeing with her! One saying she did her make-up even as her water was breaking. WHAT?! What the serious fuck?!

I'm disgusted. Seriously. She is having a child that she struggled to get pregnant with to begin with, had late term miscarriages before this and she is worried that her hair won't be done when she goes into labor like this is some kind of fucking beauty pageant? I want to slap her. I seriously want to slap her.
