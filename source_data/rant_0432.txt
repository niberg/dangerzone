I keep on giving and get nothing back

Seriously. I try A LOT. I'm the shoulder to cry on for my friends and the one to turn to when someone's in trouble. I'd do pretty much anything for anyone and I have done before. But when I'M upset, does anyone listen?! Noooo, they just say they have work or tired or family problems. No one gives me a shitty shoulder to cry on or make feel better. And then they complain when I go away! Is it too much trouble just to listen to me for once?!
