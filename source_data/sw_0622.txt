I really don't know what to say here

I really don't know what I am expecting to get from this but here it goes.... I feel like it all needs to be over for me. I am tired of it all literally and figuratively. I cant sleep any more and all I do is constantly think about grabbing the gun and taking a walk off into the woods where it is quiet. That said I think about this constantly but at the same time I don't want to do that its just that things fall apart every time. Currently tomorrow is the last day that I can appeal my eviction from my house.. in the past something like this I would have eaten it and moved on. This time I have gone since May without a paycheck and am just full up out of options. I have no family to turn to for support even just the talking kind. The only thing I have in that realm is my mother who is clinically insane. I feel like a failure and have since long ago. I have failed my first wife and son who I cant see because my ex wife wont let me and I am a failure to my new wife and son because everything just keeps getting worse and worse. In this case the shitty thing is in just a few weeks things should get better but it will be too late to save anything. My life is falling apart and I cant stop it. My justification is that if I keep continuing on eventually I will loose my wife and son anyway so whats the freaking point? I am trying to stay as level headed as I can here but I am having a hard time. I even used to be on meds which made me better.. I tried to get back onto them because I know they will help and either they want to charge which I don't have the money for or I have to go a long distance to get and appointment where they want to try alternatives. Which even in that case I couldn't get there if I wanted to as my car was repossessed.... Blah I truly give up just thinking about what I am typing is making me mad.
