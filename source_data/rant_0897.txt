How well educated people can still believe in alternative medicine, spiritual healing and similar fringe/pseudo-science is beyond me. It's bullshit. Stop sprinkling spirit/energy into every advice you provide me.

Look, dear "spiritual healing / alternative medicine / natural therapy is the best" type of person, listen to me well.

It saddens me to see that you, coming from a good educational background^(1), with a good family upbringing focused on morality and empathy^(2) are looking for answers in pseudo-science when it comes to physical and mental health.

What I mean by "pseudo-science" is homeopathy, spiritual healing, chiropractic, energy therapies such as Reiki, osteopathy, traditional medicine, scientifically unproven herbal remedies, acupuncture, etc.

Maybe you're not at fault here; maybe it's due to the inadequacy of the education systems worldwide in properly teaching and emphasizing the scientific method. Maybe your positive family upbringing has nothing to do with your inclination towards the fringe. I'm not holding these against you, my friend.

But listen; no amount of anecdotal evidence you put on the table on how your spiritual uplifting via different yoga poses and spiritual cleansing caused your skin condition to get better will be enough to convince me that it wasn't a psychosomatic symptom or a placebo/nocebo effect to begin with.

Remember my friend; it was thanks to a fucking *fungi* called *penicillium*, from which the antibiotic molecule called *penicillin* was derived through the use of proper *scientific method*, that elongated human lifespan and caused a population boom in the 20^th century by being among one of the first drugs to be effective against otherwise fatal diseases^(3), whereas the traditional and oh-so-revered *Ayurveda* has been around for literally *thousands* of years^(4) in a subcontinent *absolutely riddled with pestilence*^(5).

So, next time your Root Chakra feels closed, take some laxatives to clear your clogged intestines please, and stop believing in spiritual healing nonsense.

&gt;The mind is a vast universe where secrets are awaiting to be unlocked, mysteries to be solved, and its capacity to be unleashed.

I know, the above sounds immensely cool and mystique, but also quite childish and immature.

Trying to solve the EXTREMELY COMPLEX structure that is the human brain with layman techniques often resorted to by unskilled individuals (stuff like "unlocking the spiritual potential" and what not) is just a classic example of Dunningâ€“Kruger effect.

**TL;DR:** If you're ever going to suggest me yoga, medicine or physical therapy, keep the spiritual/pseudo-science mumbo jumbo out of it. I am patient, but may ridicule you in public if you insist.

(1) Having finished schools ranking high in national/international indices (top 20-30 institutions), and finishing above the 75^th percentile is ample evidence for me for "good education".

(2) I have to accept that this is rather more of a subjective observation, assuming that I am "the norm".

(3) There are a number of publications and papers on this subject. Check out *The Mold in Dr. Florey's Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle* by *Eric Lax* if you're more interested.

(4) Approximated origins date back to 5000 BC with humble oral-tradition beginnings. This is a Reddit rant dammit, I don't need to cite everything to everywhere. Go use Google.

(5) I'm not trying to ridicule the Indian population, which displays extreme variance throughout the subcontinent and an unimaginably vibrant and unique palette of culture, history, art and literature. However, due to overpopulation, a rampant ignorance regarding modern hygiene, some impractical traditions, poverty, pollution and a multitude of other factors such as limited access to modern medicine due to disposable income levels, India is still a problematic state on all WHO indices in the 21^st century.

**Necessary Note:**

This was written as a response to the IMMENSE amount of **themindunleashed.org** bullshit that is being posted on my Facebook feed recently. Like, go check them out. Articles start out normal and informative such as "Where to watch the blood moon", but the site starts showing its colors immediately with a follow-up line such as "...and how to use its energy properly".

There was an article posted on the best sleeping position and that sleeping by lying on the left is supposed to be "the best", since according to Ayurveda, the "lymph nodes drain to the left".

What the actual fuck.

Oh, you mean the thoracic duct? True, it's where all that don't drain into the right lymphatic duct drain, but if you lie on your left, you're actually diverting the waste substance *away* from your veins, rather than towards them. It's called *gravity* baby, gravity.  It doesn't necessarily permit fluids from draining upwards (sans capillary effect), you know. The thoracic duct empties into the internal jugular vein (middle of the body). Stuff from the left side of your body are drained into the thoracic duct. When lying on your left, your left limbs are lower in terms of gravity relative to the rest of your body. Stuff can't drain up towards your veins.

It is extremely irresponsible for self-proclaimed experts to give advice on health issues when those who practice modern medicine shed YEARS AND YEARS of blood, tears, and probably a good amount of bone marrow and hair follicles vigorously studying the human anatomy (with actual fucking cadavers), interning at hospitals (with actual fucking patients some of whom are terminal) and constantly updating their knowledge (with actual fucking information derived through *scientific method*) even during their career prime.
