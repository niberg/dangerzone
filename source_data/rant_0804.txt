My cat ruined a 1000 piece puzzle and lost a few pieces.

I've been on a puzzle kick, I've done quite a few and usually I just keep them on a big piece of poster board and slide it under my couch when I take a break, never has there been a problem. 

I was currently working on a 1000 piece puzzle and I probably had 20-30% done.

Well today I wanted to blow off a few hours while I was for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel to come out, I sit down on the floor and pull out my poster board and it's demolished. Not a few broken pieces here and there, no, my cat literally went ape-shit on this thing and broke as many pieces as she could apart. Not to mention there are 3-4 edge pieces that are just gone, I just pieced back together a few bigger pieces and then broke chunks apart and put them in a container. I worked too hard on that damn thing to want to even try to put it together again. If I ever find the edges that are missing I might try it again.

For the record, it was [this puzzle](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/171495412218?lpid=82). She must've not enjoyed me working on a puzzle with another cat on it.

For now I think I'll work on [this one though](http://www.puzzlewarehouse.com/Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-Collectors-Puzzle-pr-201406-2pol.html?caid=239&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw8O2hBRDKur2lseLW6C8SJAC-r1J3yLLnUq4ZN3URswM5KDb4n0CrVFV12q1clpJVSykuZxoCj-nw_wcB).
