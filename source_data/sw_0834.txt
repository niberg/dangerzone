what should i do??

right now im on a park bench a few miles from home. ive been contemplating whether to kill myself or not. i dont know how, maybe ill just keep walking away until i starve or something. 

i dont want to go home. mt family is abusive and doesnt care but to be fair Im very depressed and irritable and i dont do anythung except sleep and cry so its understandable.

my boyfriend is the only person that cares about me and hes worried about how hell go on without me. he lives n the other side of the equator though, so i think hell get over me.

its hard to sleep on this bench and my hands are freezinf so i cant type much. but please talk to me. i needba reason to keep going. the only person i can talk to is my bf and hes not being that supportive. i absolutely do not want to go to a foster home though.
