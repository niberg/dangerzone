I recently broke up with my girlfriend who a couple days prior told me that she had come close to committing suicide. I just need some advice on how to handle the situation please.

I had been dating a girl for about a month and a half now and she's confessed her love to me. I did not feel the same way. I tried to love her when she first told me it but I just didn't. It got to the point where I couldn't carry on the lie and lead her on anymore so I planned to break up with her this morning. this past weekend though, she confessed to me that she had been depressed for the past 6 months and had considered suicide multiple times and that she actually came close this past week. She also told me how I was the only thing stopping her from doing so. She also wen to a camp for her church this weekend and told me how much better she feels, about suicide but there's more. This morning, I could not continue this lie and lead her on more so I broke up with her. It was not mutual in the slightest. She even mentioned to a mutual friend of ours that she was going to commit suicide. 

First off for a little more context, we are in high school. It might just be her going through her teenage years or it might not be. Also, even though I broke up with her, I still care about her more than she can imagine, I just don't love her like she does(did) me.

Now, tonight, when I see my mother, I'm going to talk to her about it and get her opinion but in the meantime, I'm wondering what I should to and how I should treat this situation. 

Please ask questions too. I will answer them.
