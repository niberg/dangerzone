Why is this guy so fucking weird?!?

Okay, so there's this kid in my English class (its an upper level English class meant for people who don't like English classes) and he is without a doubt the fucking weirdest person I've ever meant. You might be saying to yourself, "well Chuck, you sound like a bit of an ass right about now." Kind people, hear me out...

He comes in every class with Chinese food (that smells like really shitty Chinese food) and proceeds to eat it with chopsticks, only he's terrible at using chopsticks. Like, one in each hand, terrible. He has no sense of personal space, like he'll just walk up right in front of your desk and be like, "I got the new iPhone yesterday let me show you how it looks" (while brandishing it in your face. I'm just trying to eat my bagel before class starts) constantly interrupts the teacher with stupid shit that has *nothing* to do with anything whatsoever. He'll raise his hand like he has a question and then tells a fucking story about what he did yesterday! What the fuck is wrong with this kid?! Still, you might be thinking to yourself, okay, so he's just a little awkward. No. A thousand times no. One time, right in the beginning of class, he asks the teacher (this is verbatim), "So... what do you think about all the black people upstairs?" (This is a really small class, mind you, &lt;20 people) The one black chick in our class just starts cracking up and for the rest of the class, everyone is going "..what the actual fuck...?" I don't actually think he's a racist, I just think he has so little of a clue about what goes on in the world that he doesn't know how to act. He's fucking weird. I feel so sorry for our teacher who has to put up with it. Fucking weird people man, can't there just be a day where we don't have to interact with a single one of them?
