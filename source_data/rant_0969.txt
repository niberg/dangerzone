Why the fuck does relish come in a squeeze bottle and why did I buy it?!

The whole point of a squeeze bottle is so you don't need to use a knife. But the relish squeeze bottle just farts out 1/4 of the container in one spot so you still need a knife to spread it out. I should've just bought relish in a jar.
