I really want to kill myself.

I feel awful right now. I'm tired. I'm so sleepy, but can't sleep. I feel disconnected from everthing all of the time, like I'm not in my body. I go between that, and feeling deeply, extremely depressed. I feel both right now, which is making me feel like dying. I wish I had a gun so I could blow my brains out. My head literally feels dizzy because I feel so fucking weird.
