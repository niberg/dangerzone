Wtf is up with Reddit and the white knight mentality?

Why does a good chunk of Reddit think they're the champions of equality, peace, love and understanding and anything anyone says against their words are all false? The funny thing is that in their charade for "equality" they themselves belittle others and contradict their supposed air of understanding by not understanding the ones they're talking against? If anything, most of these guys haven't done a thing noteworthy in real life towards bringing equality and understanding in the world, yet they're so vocal and single mindedly adamant about it?
