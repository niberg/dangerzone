About r/food

WHY DOES NO ONE KNOW HOW TO MAKE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SANDWICH?? SERIOUSLY? r/food has top posts which are just fucking sandwiches. Do people just sit at home and think "damn I wish I could make one of those bad boys"?

Jesus christ people get some actual special dishes on that shit. Fuck the world, 'nuff said.
