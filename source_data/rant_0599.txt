People who use "__fag" to label others

"Tourneyfag", "Genderqueerfag", "Furfag", "Weeaboofag", "Tumblrfag" etc.

I'm so fucking fed up of these teens around my age using this *single* suffix to defame others, just to make some selfish point about something they're looking at from a single side. If somebody really likes something, they should be able to explore it comfortably unless they're attacking others, and for reference, a handful of generally unlikeable people coming over to where you hang to "shove their dumb shit down your throat" is **NOT** an attack, and to think that it is if fucking weak as *hell* of you.

And at the very *least*, come up with something new. There are worse memes that people toss around to prove their point such as the ever-collective "Your argument is invalid", but at *least* people get called out for it semi-regularly. The only thing that calling someone a(n) *[sample]*fag does is get them angry, not strengthen your point. You're not edgy, and you most likely haven't contributed to the debate of whatever you're throwing mud at. Just fuck off, Jesus christ.
