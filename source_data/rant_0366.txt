Not sure how much longer I can continue being polite...

Seriously, why are you so *mean*?? You're, what, 40 years my senior? Yet I still manage to keep it together and be civil in the work place, something you seem to be incapable of. The next time you respond to me with a blunt "whatever" or talk down to me I might not have it in me to just walk away. I might just have to call you out on your ridiculously inappropriate behavior within the workplace. Well, for civilized society really, but especially in the workplace. What in the world makes you think it's appropriate to talk down to people the way you do? Just because I'm younger than you?

Seriously *grow up*. GROW UP. My 10 year old niece has a better attitude than you do, and she's about to go into her preteens. It's inappropriate, mean, rude, and extremely demeaning!!!
