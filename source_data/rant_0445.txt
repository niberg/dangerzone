The sick, the tired, the traumatized.

What does modern society do with the sick and the old and the traumatized? You put us in hospitals and institutions and prisons.

You take us out of society. We can't be a part of it. You put us all together in one place. 

And society keeps on creating more sick and traumatized people. And then when we finally do lose our mind, society locks us up.

The ones that hurt us are welcome in this world, and we need to be taken out of society.

What do we do with the weakest? Try to get them as far away from the actual world as possible. The same world that made us weak in the first place.

So we're alone, and confused.

That's how the modern world treats the weakest. We need the most and get the least. We need to see doctors and take medication just so the modern world doesn't have to look at it's flaws.

I'm a reminder of my parent's mistakes.

So what do they do? They exclude me and send me away. 

It's not really a rant anymore i guess.
