Less than 20,000 days remain

A time and place is difficult to assign to depression— when did this settle in? The office job, I quit, even with a hefty promotion awaiting me in two months (they would fly me across the country, each hour away paid for). The next job, (data entry for a financial firm) I quit, even with their gratitude, their pleasant smiles—“ such a hard worker,” they said. “Such a fast learner.” The call center job, I did not quit. Shifts ran from 2 two AM to ten AM, a full day ahead for exploration— this routine was manageable and even, at times, enjoyable. Influenza struck, left me bedridden for weeks—“ No, stay home,” they said. “You need rest.” Another week passed; they said, “Your numbers are great. But we’re sorry, we need you here. We’re letting you go.” An offer for teaching children English in Japan arrived. They accepted my cover letter, resume, and essay—“ please, come to Seattle,” they said. Three days, my lesson plan was written, prepared, and ready. DMV called: “Your license has been suspended for thirty days due to three traffic violations within a two-year-period.” Tony offered to drive me to the interview. I sat at my computer, calculating the overseas-teaching salary and living expenses (monthly allotment: 270,000 yen, under 11% tax rate. Rent : 42,000 yen; Insurance: 30,000 yen; Utilities: 10,000-15,000 yen; Food: 50,000-75,000 yen. Airfare to and from Japan not provided. Cell phone or landline costs not included.) How much will I save? Driving to this meeting has a price. “You talked yourself out of it,” Tony said. “You aren’t even giving yourself the opportunity to turn an offer down, at least finding out you’re qualified.”

My therapist terms it “pre-psychotic disorder.”

My other therapist labeled my behavior as “obsessive.”

A translucent-orange pill bottle sits atop a wrinkled notebook and the physics tome.

An indescribable void eats from within, crippling. I lie in my bed for days as they were seconds, weeks as they were hours. Blink. Pass.

Tony witnessed a suicide, eating lunch outside, paperwork-jargon jumbled in his head. People were shouting, pointing. He looked up. A man balanced atop a parkade, arms circling. Shouting intensified. The crunching sound mimicked the sandwich he ate.

Days before, his childhood friend died of an asthma attack, songs they wrote together stuck on repeat, recorded only to memory.

“There is no time,” Tony said, dazed.

Blank pages remain in this wrinkled journal.

28,470 days to live. That comes to age seventy-eight.

Being twenty-seven, I have so far lived 9,855 days.

Less than 20,000 days remain.

If my remaining years were dispersed among the living, each American gains roughly three seconds. Tony lounges on the couch after work, imagining the dinners he will make his children— we express insecurity with shop tools, how to build, and how to parent.

“I want to learn.”

“We teach ourselves.”

Fortuned without food scavenging and the likes of living wild, our “civilized” pursuits are intellectual. The struggle has gone mental.

In the basement of a university library, I discovered a tomb of knowledge to which I am particularly inclined. *World of Physics, Vol I, Weaver.*

“Study your passion,” my friend says.

“Prioritize your passion,” Tony says.

Less than 20,000 days remain.

If I stared long enough at a single point… say, I was standing in a room and staring, not into a corner or at a blank wall, but if I stared long enough holding my friend’s hand while I did so (her presence provides such strength), I could see into that spot, into this empty air, this vacuum, this invisible little nothingness between the ceiling and the floor and the walls, the part we walk through daily without feeling it pass through us.

If I stared into the nonspecific space long enough I might see the atoms buzzing.

There is a law in quantum mechanics stating the specific placement of an atom cannot be exacted. A definite number cannot place its presence. The measurements are given in scientific notation so as to account for error. *This is because the atoms are never not moving.* Everything buzzes always. Without movement, nothing survives. Without our moon’s gravity and the tidal push, organic matter does not shift; life does not emerge on land. Stagnant lakes harbor death and bacteria. With only movement do life and light exist. With collision, new life is birthed. With a dying star, elements are hurled out into nothingness; here, debris collects and compacts. Planets are made. They move. The atoms they are made of move.

The laws of physics we must submit to are specific to us and our size. Our atoms do not follow these laws; they follow their own. How is it the very essence of which we are made does not follow the same rules?

Meteors and red giants and colliding galaxies are forever rushing. We are stuck between the quantum-sized fabric of matter and ominous threats, the larger, unfeeling, relentless beasts. We are the Middle, a harmonizing of the unseen and the incomprehensible, all coalescing into brawn and sensuality and intellect and humor.

Vibrations of the atoms affect each erogenous pocket of matter—

screaming, we enter
pleading, we exit
How magnificent, how frightening

this begs interpretation but Truth remains evasive (“ truth?” is misguided begging)

*Another quantum law states how no prediction can be reached on what will happen in any given circumstance.*

**Please don't hurt yourself. You have this one life. This one opportunity to harness the energy you are in charge of and do wonderful things with it. Why waste your one shot? Imagine every process within and outside of yourself--the microcosmos, the macrocosmos--you are fortunate to have cognizance of any of these.**

**Use it.** Don't destroy. **Create.**
