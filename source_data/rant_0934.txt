YOU DON'T TAKE MY MUNCHIES AWAY FROM ME. YOU JUST DON'T.

So, after smoking weed, my appetite was greatly doubled. I ate a few pieces of chicken to satiate myself. 




Luckily, my sister came from out of the blue and and handed my a bar of dark chocolate. I put it in the fridge first, saving it for later as I still needed to attend to some matters.





Stoners of reddit, you know how your appetite increases when your bombed. 





Little did I know my motherfucking father already ate my bar. Fuck! I was saving it for later. Care to ask first before you go chowing on someone else's stuff? Stupid son of a bitch. I don't care if we have this blood relation, YOU JUST DON'T TAKE MY MUNCHIES especially when I'm stoned. Fuck you.
