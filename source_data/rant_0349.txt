Kids stole the whole bucket of candy off the porch...

I was taking my two year old trick or treating, so I did the whole thing where you leave a bucket of candy out on the porch... Kids took the whole dang bucket... And the boyfriend just sat inside the whole time. It's only two hours. Could he just sit out there for two fucking hours...
