I hate people.

Not sure if this is the right subreddit. I am devastated. Someone I trusted stole something from me that can't ever be replaced, my mothers ring.  Something that I've carried with me for over a decade, which says a lot since I lose everything.  I hate people. I hate that I can't let anyone in my house anymore. I've had so many things stolen from me since I moved here and now I just hate here. I feel like there's way more "bad" people here than there were back east. So many drug addicts and homeless desperate people who are willing to do anything to anyone with no regard to the impact of their actions.  Its a pain in my chest similar to heartbreak. I have never been materialistic to any length because I've always moved around and lost just about everything, but this one thing...meant more to me than anything else I own, by far, and I am undone.
