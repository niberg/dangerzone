Being left out fuckin sucks

I hate it. I don't think I'm entitled to anyone giving more than 2 shits about me, but this feeling sucks. I wouldn't have left him out. We didn't. It just wasn't an option. "He's not here? Let's do something else instead." Now I'm unavailable and they're having a blast. Whatever. I will, to the best of my ability, never make someone I somewhat care about feel like this.
