This Morning I tried To Commit Suicide

This morning I attempted to kill myself.

Around a month ago I posted on here about how my life was going downhill. This morning, i decided enough was enough, I was going to end my pain and suffering.

A week after I made that post, life took a sudden uphill, i got a girlfriend, had a stable relationship with my family and my grades were improving in school! Then it happened.

I was told to go to the hospital. I had no idea why, in all honesty i was scared. The doctor sat me down and told me i had been falsely diagnosed with schizophrenia for 5 years. This juts, completely shook my world, i didn't know what to do with myself. A third of my life was spent being scared of people in case I hurt them turn out it was all for nothing.

After hearing this my girlfriends split up with me, she probably just felt sorry for me and decided to have a bit of a laugh and date me. That was the thing that got me into the mess i am now.  I made a promise with one of my friends that we would never self harm again. I broke the promise and I'm 80% sure he hasn't forgiving me.

At this point, all i live for is the relatively small Minecraft PvP group i play with, those guys are the only people that actually seem to care about me. I tried to disconnect myself from them so i could focus on my upcoming GCSE's but now I've come to realise that those people like me, and turning my back on the would be a horrible thing to do.

This morning, I couldn't take the last pills, I was throwing up everywhere, bleeding. It was horrible, but if life doesn't improve, I'll take those last pills, and just, end it all.
