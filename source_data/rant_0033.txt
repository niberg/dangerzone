You stop being a bride after you get married!

This is my rant for the day because I can’t say it out loud publically, lest I offend…;)

My SIL, who I am pretty much estranged from, had a shotgun wedding at the courthouse about a year and a half ago.  No family was present, not even her parents (though they knew/were happy it was happening).  No doubt in my mind she got pregnant on purpose and was desperate to tie down a man.  Anyway…she’s getting married AGAIN next year (same husband).  She’s been planning her “dream wedding” for the 13 years I’ve known her (since her teens) and had two engagements before she married her husband.  It’s just so tacky to me – to have this big, church, white dress wedding 2 YEARS after actually getting married!!!  Why the timing?  It really comes down to money.  She couldn’t afford this crap while pregnant and waiting tables, so they’re saving up to do it now and her kid will be old enough to be cute and involved in the ceremony.

I don’t mind them having some sort of party, celebration, but a full-on wedding/reception two years after the fact? C’mon…It’s also annoying that I keep getting “Bridal Shower” invitations and gift registry stuff.  Girl, you’re already married and IMO, you forfeited your right to a $10,000 party after you had a child.  Put that money into a college account and chill out.  YOU ARE NOT A BRIDE.  YOU ARE A WIFE.

Still can’t decide if we’re going.  It’s an out of town trip for us, neither me or my husband talk to her, and I don’t care to spend the money.  It’s one of those “No one cares if we’re there, but they will if we don’t show up” things.  Such bullshit.
