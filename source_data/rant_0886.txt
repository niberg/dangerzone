Whenever I care about a project it gets fucked up.

I go to a school where I always have at least one project due for a class. I'm not the type of person to give much of a fuck for anything. However I do have projects that I legitimately do give a fuck about. I push myself to actually do my best and make it look excellent, and 80% of the time I fail. All the other projects that I finish well I could throw out of a fucking window or burn, but the ones that I actually try to do decently on I mess up. I break them, I make an irreversible mistake, something along those lines. This one that finally broke me was an attempt at making an emotionally representative sculpture that I had a good idea for. Of course I cracked it in fucking half, so I just sat there for 30 minutes wailing on it with a chisel. I was going for calm, but after I broke it and started going to town all that was going into it was anger. I guess with that it'll be a much more real emotion.
