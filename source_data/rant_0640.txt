If it looks like shit, smells like shit and acts like shit, you don't have to continue dating him to know he's full of shit

He let you get close to him, let you air your grievances over the years as "friends" yet never fully opened up himself only revealing interests, lied about who he hangs out with and the frequency even though you never once asked, says he's only dating you even though again you never asked so why feel the need to constantly reassure you? Fuck him. You trusted him, known him since you were kids and sure you're 25 and he just visited you from home acting "romantic" all weekend faking everything but you aren't and haven't been looking for dirty details and that's all you keep stumbling upon.  Fuck this guy and his bullshit. So fucking pissed. I thought he was it for me but it's time to focus on getting my life in line rather than things that just don't matter right now.  Get your shit together, kick him out of your life, you're getting too old for this shit.  I'm done with asshats who are pleased with themselves and their abilities to play girls, it's not a good thing I can promise you that guys. How happy are you really? Random sex hasn't made me happy longer than for the time it lasted and quantity isn't going to help either. Fuck you and your bullshit. I'm done I'm so fucking done.
