I feel like it's close to happening for real soon.

I'm 24 years old and have been suicidal since I was 15. It's been a long and grueling road just staying alive. Everytime something even remotely bad happens, it sends me right to the edge. What's triggering me tonight? I messed up putting in the house alarm security code to the house that I cat-sit at. The alarm was blaring and I couldn't get it to go off. I just started crying and calling 911 and knocking on the neighbors doors. Everyone from the 911 operator to the neighbors I talked to were rude to me which only made me feel worse. The police eventually came and helped me and it calmed me down a bit but now as the situation has been resolved I'm still crying and cannot take this heavy feeling in my heart. I feel bad that I messed up the alarm and ruined everyone's night. To me, this is final confirmation that I'm not strong enough to keep on going in this life. Normal people would shrug this off, but nope...not me. This fiasco has me clutching a pair of scissors that I'm ready to jam into my wrists.I don't know what's wrong with me but I can't stop shaking. I feel like if this doesn't kill me then the next shitty thing definitely will. I think I'm writing this here as some form of catharsis. I need to try to relieve this heavy feeling any way I can, whether it's writing here or slitting my wrists
