Can't think straight.

I'm 16 and in high school, I've always been pretty good at school and was pretty happy overall, but recently I just stopped caring about things, I started failing classes, and I can't take it anymore. I know that a lot of people have had it worse than me and I feel like shit for being like this. Whenever I try, I always quit at the last second which makes me feel worse because I know I'll never go through with anything in life. Being torn between suicide and my family and friends is screwing with me and I have no clue what to do.

Sorry for wasting your time.
