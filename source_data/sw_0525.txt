Help finding songs like Life By the Drop

Throwaway obviously.

Long story short. Hard time in my life, lots of bad happening, and alcohol kinda helps. Regardless I'm looking for some songs to listen to that start ok, seem to go a little bad, and end up being ok again and mostly just guitar and vocals. Much like Stevie Ray Vaughan's Life By the Drop. That song got me to put down the bottle and pick up my guitar again (for about two fucking days) but now that I've got it figured out I'm drinking again.

I'll probably get down voted for being a sad little bitch, but oh fucking well it's better than nothing.

Seriously anything similar would be great. I want to play so bad, but can't find anything that catches my attention. Long enough to play. Thankfully I heard Life By the Drop on the radio and it gave me a taste of the passion I used to have for guitar. That passion went down the tubes along with my school career. When I got so fucking sick the specialist couldn't figure out how I walked into his office once let alone twice. But that was completely out of my control and drove me right out of my mind! Yeah I'll just slave away in a god damn plant with a bunch of animals. Not like I was a fucking engineering student or anything! Yep! From engineering student to a mother fucking plant worker in less than a year due to things entirely out of my control. This has made my goal for the day making it past the 435 overpass without the thought of unbuckling my seatbelt and plowing into the pillar crossing my mind my goal for the day for the past couple months. 

And to top it all off right now for all I know a family friend is dead right now. All know is he was in brain surgery with a 30â„… chance that was then backed off to 20%.

Wish I could go in his place. He's far better of a man than I'll ever be. He's already given far more than I ever will be capable of. Especially as a god damned plant worker!
