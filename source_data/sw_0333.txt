I'm sure someone on here can convince me not to kill myself

So, I'm not going to sit around and tell you about my sob story, but if you want to know my reasons you can read this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2km6yt/is_this_considered_abuse/

But I don't think the reason I want to do it matters, though. I've been on prozac for about a year, and my dosages have been going up every couple months or so. I'm currently taking 60 mg every morning.

I've attempted suicide a couple times before but each time I chickened out. I think I'm going to try again tonight and see what happens.

Can someone please give me a reason to live other than the "it'll hurt everyone around you" bullshit? Because I honestly just feel so numb to everything at this point that I really don't see a point in carrying this on. I don't want to die but nothing in life sounds good enough to live for either.
