DON'T FUCKING BUY FOOD IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO EAT IT.

Living with your girlfriend is the worst fucking idea in the world.  She reads stupid recipes on Pinterest, like a fucking green smoothie, and gets it in her head that she's going to make it.  That's until she forgets and leaves a fuckload of apples and pears in the fruit bowl until they were rotting and covered in mold.

I can't even fucking throw them out when they're starting to go because she insists she'll use them.

THIS HAPPENS AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH.  IT'S SO FUCKING GROSS.

**AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**
