I've hit a dead end and need help escaping.

I've lived in my current town for around 8 years. For a majority of that time it was smooth sailing but these two past years everything just went downhill. I had a schizophrenic episode in which I got violent and in turn got arrested for. Since then people have always snickered about my mental stability. Living in Tennessee I've also always suffered racial abuse because most people assume I'm Mexican even though I'm Italian. There's also been problems with people disapproving of me always protecting those who have been bullied. Now that I'm midway through high school, I've essentially become a target for insult. You put that on top of the fact that my girlfriend of 2 years just committed suicide, and I'm just absolutely depressed now. My counselor has told me that I just need a new location, but my parents refuse to spend any money to let me leave. I've always been very academically gifted though so I've tried looking for ways to use that to get me into some sort of boarding/away school. With me just now taking up the habit of cutting and various suicidal attempts I fear that now staying where I live is hazardous to my well-being. I guess what i'm asking is if you guys know of anyway I could leave my home using my academic skills opposed to my parents having to pay.
