How do they keep releasing mediocre games?

A good friend gifted me Destiny so we could play together...and all I can think while playing is "this might be the most average game I've ever played...how the FUCK does that happen?!"

It's 2014...and I've been gaming for a LONG time. Along the way there's been some amazing, revolutionary games...so how the FUCK do companies keep releasing these mediocre pieces of shit?! 

Destiny is an okay game. Is it more fun than say Left 4 Dead? No. Is it more fun than the first Call of Duty? No. And yet...they had all the money in the world to develop it and a studio with a track record of successful games behind it...and yet it's still JUST OKAY.

The matchmaking SUCKS in the game. WHY?! This isn't the first game to have matchmaking! It's been around for more than a decade!

The PvP is laggy as shit! How the fuck does that even happen?! I'm still playing games that are 5-6 years old that don't have near this lag.

How do you see studios release successful, story driven games like Mass Effect, Last of Us, Metal Gear and think "Fuck the story! We'll just give them a slightly interesting setting but explain NONE of it!"

I'm still waiting for that GREAT next-gen game to come out...I don't think it's coming. I think gaming has hit a fucking wall of mediocrity and I don't know if we'll ever see a truly awesome game ever again.
