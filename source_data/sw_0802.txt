It's the only thing that gives me joy.

The only happy thought I have, is the realization that I have enough control to end my pain. I don't want to excist anymore. Im tired of dealing with living. I'm a doctoral canidate, recently finished my masters, have a wife, and a daughter. Im a mensa member, with an IQ of 175. I've got everything going for me, but I cant fake it anymore. I've stopped caring, and I want to die. I want it more than anything. Don't know why I decided to post this.
