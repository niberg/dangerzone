The Irish Republican Army and peoples misconceptions.

I have seen too many times people call the IRA terrorists when they have no idea.

Look into history, of all the revolutions, why is the only one to be marked terrorism, the Irish one? I don't get it, the people of Ireland where starved, murdered and forced into slavery by the British, who came to take our land - and actually, to this day, still own a large portion of it, which I won't go into.. But, when the Irish Republican Army was formed, they were the counter terrorists, not the terrorists. 
the British Army terrorized the people for a really long time - yet, they're seen as a great nation, whilst, the Irish Republican Army are deemed 'terrorists' - I COMPLETELY AGREE that the current gangs claiming to be the Irish Republican Army IN MODERN TIMES are scum, but, the actual Irish Republican Army did NOT hold the same motivation as the people going around now, the Irish Republican Army fought for the freedom of this country FROM the terrorists, just like a lot of countries before them, and, after, they were not terrorists, I don't understand how they could be conceived as terrorists?  Wouldn't you fight back against the people STARVING you, your family, your friends, your community? Wouldn't YOU fight back against the people STEALING your land? Are the Police in your country terrorists because they stopped that person stealing your property? You decide.

tl;dr The IRA weren't terrorists, the current gangs claiming to be the IRA, RIRA, whatever are not the actual IRA.
