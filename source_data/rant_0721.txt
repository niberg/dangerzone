I am fucking tired of this "No GMO Added" bullshit.

First, absolutely no one has told me "I don't want farmers beholden to seed companies every year" or "I believe they'll eventually intrude on the natural environment." It's always some half-assed "I think they're secretly bad for me or my kids" superstition. (Source: I own a pair of grocery stores and people are absolutely insane about this shit. And yet groceries are always too expensive.)
Second, it's a misleading label that nearly anyone can put on their product. If I make a tomato that uses cactus genes to do with less water, I haven't added any genetically modified organisms to my genetically modified organism.  
Most upsetting to me though, it's just fucking backwards. We've selecting which genes of animals get to continue for millennia and we finally get a chance to actually select which specific genes are propagated in such a way that will keep the genepool strong and diverse while still improving yields and people pull their freaking hair out. We're taking a  *deeper* interest in our actions on other species not just changing things haphazardly. 
**Aargh!**
