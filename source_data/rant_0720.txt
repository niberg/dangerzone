Well, I feel like the worst girlfriend ever.

My SO's birthday happens to be tomorrow. I bought him something of the internet and it arrived damaged. Needless to say, that's getting sent back. Now I have no birthday present for him. (It is something I can't get in a store around here)

AND I'm stuck spending the night apart from him tonight. We live together, but I'm a student still. I occasionally crash at school with friends for the night. I was done with all but one class by lunch time. I stayed at school 6 hours waiting for my evening class to get there and find out it was an optional class.  

The weather got bad since lunch and I have a long drive, do in stuck here at this point. He's going to wake up alone on his birthday and I have no gift for him. I just want to cry, but then I'd only make his day worse. 

TL;DR my so's birthday is tomorrow and I have no gift and I'm stuck an hour away alone.
