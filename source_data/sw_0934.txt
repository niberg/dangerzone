*sigh* Well here goes

Yeah.. didn't think my evening would end up here. 
I'm 30. Recently my sister died after a long ordeal through cancer. About a month before her death... I opened up to her about sexual abuse I was a victim of. ( from around 2 till 5 ish..) And was beginning to deal with that. Now she was the only person I told this. Shortly after that.. she gets seriously ill from complications from cancer. 2 weeks in ICU... and passes away. Dealing with that and having opened up old wounds from childhood... is really just too much. Past few days I have been sinking ever deeper into depression and shame. I want to tell my family.. I want to get help. But I just lock up and stay away from people. for 2 days now I've looked at my sleeping pills and thoughts of ending it all... are going on all the time. I feel guilty, ashamed, weak and utterly worthless. I see family and friends daily... and am so afraid to tell them. I turn in to a little child inside.. whose core belief is that I am worthless, unlovable and a waste of oxygen. I am so lost in my thoughts right now.
