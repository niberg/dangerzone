I almost got hit by a car twice while walking my dog this afternoon

I live in a small town that has about 1,500 people (When combined with the two towns surrounding us, alone we have about 800-1,000 if were lucky.) and nobody obeys the speed limit of 25 mph that affects the whole town. This makes it dangerous to do anything outside of let animals outside because they might get hit by a car (Most of the time the driver never even admits what they did.). While I was walking my dog we crossed an intersection after I looked both ways for cars. Suddenly a car came down the road way too fast and missed my dog my inches. We continuted walking after I made sure she was OK and turned around, walking until we got to the same intersection. Once again I looked for cars, once again a car missed both of us by inches. The most annoying part of this is I have a friend that is in the junior firefighters program at the fire station and she said that on Halloween people would slow down when they saw the firefighters wearing saftey vests and then speed up again as soon as they got past the fire station and most days there are 20-30 speeding tickets handed out by the police officers that only even patrol the town from 10 A.M. 10 12 P.M. because we have to share our police with three or four other towns.
