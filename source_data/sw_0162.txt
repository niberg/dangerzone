I just can't do it anymore..

im 20years old i don't even know what im doing anymore. i thought things were getting better i finally told my mom that i was having severe panic attacks at least once a week, and i was gonna talk to someone tomorrow but now im just thinking whats the point.. College is just too much lately, someone i consider one of my best friends is mad at me ( or at least i think she is) and i just don't want to do it anymore i can't . The past few days ive thought about running away or crashing my car, anything so i don't have to put up with this anymore. im sorry if this all doesnt make sense its all just coming out and im just done.

im sorry for posting, there are so many more people on here that need to be listened to more than i do.

again sorry if this made no sense at all, so 
bye.
