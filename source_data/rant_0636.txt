Why Gay/Lesbian People Annoy Me

Before I begin, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with any gay or lesbian people or their choices.

What really irritates me about gay and lesbian people as a whole is that they feel the need to constantly express it, but get mad if they're treated "different".  I'm straight, and don't go up to them or walk around town and let the world know that I'm straight, I just live my life.  That's where the problem comes in.  They want everyone to treat them the same as everyone else, but in all reality, they want to be recognized and treated better.  If they just lived their lives and went about their own business like straight people, maybe there wouldn't be so much controversy about it.  I'm not even saying that in a negative way, but in modern day when it is so widely accepted, there's no reason to continue to make it a controversial topic.
