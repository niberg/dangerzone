so sick of getting down voted on reddit for no reason!

this really pisses me off, I post a cute pic of my geckos or my axolotl or i ask a question about my pets because I couldn't find info on the internet and get down voted for this? what the fuck. seriously what the hell did I do to deserve a down vote. &gt;(
