Six Weeks until the big day

I've had a lot of Pain and Agony in the last few years. I thought last year was the worst year of my life but in the 11 month of this year I stand corrected. I just can't take it any more, I live with chronic pain everyday I can't even walk the one mile to school, I use to run five daily. Most of my friends, hobbies, and potential careers are activity oriented. I had a rough childhood and all of that fun stuff along with crippling debt from medical bills. These last two years have been hard, I've lost my childhood home, my father and the love of my life. I can't get the girl out of my head.  I just got a 2week notice from my landlord to add more stress and I'm failing my classes. I've been this depressed before just not this "hopeless" you know? I know how to make my death look like an accident for the sake of my loved ones through a hyper sensitive allergy. They're the only reason I'm here right now. 

So I set a date, I'm sticking too it. Things have seemed to have eased up in my life since then, just knowing all the pain will soon stop. Every night the best dreams I have are of suicide, I wake up several times from the pain. I'm getting rid of my personal belongings and giving the good things to my friends. I'm spending all of my money for gifts for x-mas. I'm pretending to live life as I normally would and just trying to let my loved ones know that I do in fact love them.
