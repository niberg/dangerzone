I can't wake up tomorrow.

I don't wish to live anymore. I became withdrawn from society about 10 years ago due to a problem with the DMV. I wasn't able to get anywhere but work so I learned to be alone. Now I'm completely withdrawn and have lost the ability to connect with others. I don't like being around people in any way. I get upset after prolonged contact with others. This has made working for a living a complete hell. I have no family left. All I had was my Dad and I lost him 20 years ago last month. I'm a failure at life in almost every sense of the word. My few successes don't add up to a hill of beans. Due to my mental short comings I am untreatable. I've been invited to work parties but don't go because I don't like being around those people. The price of groceries has steadily increased over the past few years. It's now to the point where I need a new job that pays more. My mental condition prevents me from doing so. I've gone as far as getting dressed up and prepairing myself for a job interview just to sit in the parking lot for several hours before admitting failure and going back home. I lost the energy to deal with others or any of life's problems. Nothing advances while I'm in this state. Everything has halted and now I'm 10 years behind my peers. I'm at the point where I can't make enough money for retirement. I have nothing to look forward to. I just want to hurry up and get this over with so I don't have to wake up tomorrow. Everyday is misery and a constant reminder of how much of a failure and alone I am in this world. It's better that I kill myself.
