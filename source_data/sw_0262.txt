i have no one.

i feel so unloved and alone. we've been together for 9 years now, and i feel like i'm dying of a broken heart. i feel like i'm going crazy. my heart has just become so small over the years. i replay these awful moments and feel my stomach drop, i feel a weird pain inside my elbows. 


he can say he loves me.

but he doesn't show it.

he doesn't ever remember our anniversary.

he cuts me off mid-sentence any time i'm speaking.

he makes me feel like i have to beg him for sex.

never once complimented me.

i'm a pathetic, needy, whiny cry baby.

i beg for any nice words.

i give gifts, compliments, nice gestures constantly and now i am very empty.

he said he'd fuck his ex if she lived close.


i want so badly to be a good wife.
i want to be with him for the rest of my life.
