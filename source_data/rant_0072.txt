College is draining my soul.

I'm a PR major (quickly to change, I'm transferring schools after the year, and changing my major with it) and one of the classes I'm required to take is an intro to start comm where it's split 8 weeks with a pr prof, 8 weeks with an ad prof. The first 8 weeks, it was my absolute favorite class, but now with the switch, I'm in the class of a cunt that missed the entire second week of our class because she travelled, and will miss another week right before finals. That's 2 weeks out of 8. When she is there, she just tells us the same fucking anecdotes a million times, and barely teaches, and then grades super fucking hard. My grade is going down from an almost perfect score and it's almost a B. I can handle professors that don't teach and give good grades, and I can take difficult professors that make students earn the grade, but someone that spends the entire class asking her TA if she's told the story already, and my grade is going done is completely infuriating. I don't even like college, honestly. I feel depressed and it's not because I don't have friends here, or  anything to do, I'm just sick of the menial stuff. I know these are supposed to be the best years, but I feel suffocated by them. I just had to get that off my chest, because it's driving me insane. I need to get out of here.
