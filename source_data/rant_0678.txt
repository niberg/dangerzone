Freeloaders

I hate people who steal. So I was pissed when I saw that people were getting into the gym for free. And then had the audacity to sell stolen goods, like shooters sleeves, to the people there. I'm rich by no means, and work to pay for my  membership. God damn I don't know why this is pissing me off so much.
