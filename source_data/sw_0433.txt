- Everything has just too much

Im very lost and can't see a way out. 
3 weeks ago I lost my job, and have had no luck with anything else. I have no qualifications, and Just about to turn 30.
2 days ago my girlfriend of 8 years left me as she no longer sees a future with me. She was my everything, and I can't imagine doing anything without her by my side. Knowing that she can do this so easily, and after so long and whilst I'm this fragile has really made me Feel worthless.
And without her help I'll be homeless by the end of the month. 
I don't have many friends, and no one else to talk to. 
Last night I stood on the balcony and looked 12 floors down and imagined hitting floor, but couldnt do it. Today I have procured something that could help take me that step. 
I don't know what to do.
