Art club sucks

So I was drug to this stupid art club thing with my girlfriend. I love the teacher, he's a great guy. but oh my god, the other students are fucking awful. The modo could honestly be "feel sorry for me, imaginary people pick on me" they have bot shut up about how they hate other people who has never said anything to or about them. Not only do they complain about them, they fucking trash talk just about any other girl that isn't as "heavy" as them. There's only like 2 heavier girls in the entire club, and the rest are pretty skinny. Thanks for letting me rant.
