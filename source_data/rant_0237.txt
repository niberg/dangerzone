I wish people would stop using garbage image hosts.

There are lots of image hosts on the Internet. And most of them suck. To the people that use ImageShack, TinyPic, Photobucket, or the like, *STOP USING THOSE CRUMMY HOSTS!!*

I'm tired of ImageShack's and TinyPic's all-around garbage and image removals, and Photobucket's gone down the shitter with their direct linking now taking viewers to some bullshit page where you can "buy framed images!" and "download the image to your computer!" when you probably just want to view the bloody image.
