A simple message of greeting would be perfect

I'm sure others here have experienced this repeatedly, and I'm sure a fair amount have suffered with *long* bouts of loneliness that have caused their suicidal feelings to spiral deeper and deeper.
I have spent most of my life alone. I am used to being alone and I don't really mind it so much. 

Simply the smallest little tidbit of words would be great right now. I don't even really need to talk about how I feel, I can handle it all inside. Rather just to talk about hobbies or interests, thoughts etc would be fantastic. Honestly, something so simple would interest me. Not politics or religion though, that'd just annoy us both if we differed.

I am feeling rather suicidal I must admit, but I've been handling those feelings for all my life. I'll be fine, I know deep down just like the hundreds of other times that I'll be fine. I guess I'm just quite lonely.
