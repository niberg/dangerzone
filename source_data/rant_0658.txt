Fuck you, /r/polandball.

Seriously, the mods there do not know what the fuck they are doing half the time. I've progressed rapidly since my first comic, came up with an original idea, but my comic was still denied on the grounds that it's "people" and not countries interacting.

What the fuck? That makes no sense! A country is a group of people! I've seen comics before that describe national events and holidays!

I've seen people on that subreddit, even the mods themselves, break the rules they're so quick to enforce! I've seen them use line tool, seen them copypaste previous balls into other slides, seen them talk about "people" instead of countries...

/r/polandball. There, I fucking linked it. The entire sub is just an "old boy's club". No one's allowed in except the founders, whom, I don't know who the fuck decided they should be the absolute authority on polandball. Half of them make unfunny "sweeden is teh best amirite" jokes and the other half are inactive!

Fuck polandball mods.
