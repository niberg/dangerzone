I'm depressed and have suicidal thoughts. Somebody help me.

I never thought I would do this but I think I seriously need help so here it goes...

I'm a 2x year old who recently graduated from good college. I've never been this depressed in my life where I'm actually looking up ways to end my life online and seriously considering it. No one really knows I'm depressed because I don't really show it. 

The depression comes from a number of things: (1) For a number of reasons I'm still looking for a job; (2) Feel like somewhat of a failure because I haven't really accomplished anything in life and I'm still looking for a job while all of my friends already have one; (3) broke up with my gf around 2 months ago (long story and I don't want to get into it because I'm afraid someone might know who I am - somewhat related to the job search); (4) I've been unbelievably unlucky - I had a final interview recently but didn't do well because I became sick the day right before it; (5) recently found out my ex is traveling with another guy; (6) I feel really alone and empty inside; and (7) the thought of, well, what is the point of living? Even if I do find a job, I'll just work 9-5 everyday, come back home, maybe hang out with friends, and watch some TV...and repeat. 

To be honest, the only thing that is probably keeping me back is that I don't know how my parents would take it - but I think they'll cope. 

I know I sound a whiny and lots of people have it worse than me, but I'm really having a hard time and I'm usually not like this.
