It's just a waiting game

I believe I have undiagnosed BPD. 

Three days ago i was given 72 hours notice to find a new place to live. The people telling me this were my roommates and closer then blood best friends. They went behind my back and signed a lease together that starts today. They couldn't give me a real reason why they did it. But i could see that it was largely because they couldn't deal with me anymore. They couldn't deal with my mood swings, my depression and my being there. 

They both knew I'd attempted suicide a few weeks ago. They both knew i'd attempted suicide using a different method a few weeks before that. They both know my third method is firearm. So here i am, living with my parents again. Living in a house full of firearms that i have easy access to. Emotionally i feel devastated, destroyed even. 

All last night i planned how to tell my former roommates what they did to me, how much more likely i am to screw around and pull the trigger. I don't know if i should. I don't know if i care enough anymore. So now my life is a waiting game. I'm waiting until something triggers another massive depressive spiral (like being betrayed by those i trusted most) and i finally succeed. 

I don't know why i'm posting this. Maybe i want help, maybe i want them to find it, or maybe i just want a record of the situation. All i know is soon enough i won't be here anymore and it won't be my problem any longer.
