I hate myself and find it difficult to live day by day with my thoughts

I should first say that I don't truly think I will go all out and commit suicide, but I justifiably hate myself and find it hard to control and put up with my daily negative inner dialog, so I regularly fantasize about dying. 

I ruin all relationships I have. I'm 30 years old and have just ruined another very meaningful one.
In my relationship of 10 months with this girl I regularly lost control of my emotions and started arguments which led to me saying horrible things to her. Over time it made her hate me and now she completely ignores me. It's difficult to think of a girl who you loved and they loved you now hating you. But this is a regular pattern for me.

I'm just not sure I'm able to break this, I feel it's something unchangeable at the core of me... unbalanced, emotional, dramatic, selfish, manipulative  and down right mean.

How do people live with themselves when they know deep down what scum they are? How do I?
