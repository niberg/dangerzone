Suicide

I am going to kill myself. It is all I want to do. Die. And I will have my wish by the end of the weekend. 
People are so mean.
People are awful.
Time to give them what they want. They want the money that is available when I pass. They set me up, ruined my life. It's a painful existence and nobody will help me. Everyone wants me dead.
And I accept it now.
