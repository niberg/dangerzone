Thought I Was Gonna Be Ok

I used to really struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts, but the last few months, really since about May I've been fine. The last 2 weeks or so, for no reason and without warning, every single one of those feelings has come back. 

I feel so hopeless. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this, my friends have been through so much with me I can't put anymore on them. I'm traveling this weekend and I keep coming back to just ending it all when I get back. I'd get to say a nice goodbye to the most important people and then just be done. It hurts but at the same time it feels almost comforting.  I don't know why I'm posting this here, other than I guess maybe I'm hoping someone telling me not to do it will make me not want to.
