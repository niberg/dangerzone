My sister and her boyfriend being very sexual WHEN I'M IN THE SAME ROOM.

This happened last night and it's very irritating and disgusting. I have to share a room with my sister and her boyfriend who now lives here, We live in a 2 bedroom apartment with six people so not sharing is not a choice. Now I don't mind sharing a room with them for the most part they're out at the shops or something like that and her boyfriend is a nice person, much nicer than her old boyfriend who also used to live here...But what I DO MIND is the "love making" there's usually them tickling and groping which causes a lot of screaming from my sister, when they kiss it sounds so fucking disgusting all I can wonder to myself is "HOW MUCH FUCKING SPIT ARE YOU TWO SHARING??". But the fucking granddaddy of them all was tonight MY SISTER WAS GIVING HIM A BLOWJOB. They acted like I was blind and couldn't hear them. God...Thank fuck she was giving him a bj under the covers if she wasn't I think I would have projectile vomited all over the place. So, Reddit what do you think? How fucked up is this? Is it even fucked up at all?
