Is it really ok to go chasing after people?

Every other day it seems there's a post from someone outside SW that someone else just has to bring to SW's attention, and every single time the kumbaya patrol rushes out to invade that thread with "don't do it!" "You have so much to live for" "We love you." and ...

Pardon me I had to vomit for a sec there...

other stuff  that basically violate guidelines 1A as well as 4A through D.

I feel it's equivalent to finding the person personal info and then sending the cops there.

I've also seen instances where things devolve into shouting matches between norms and Sw'ers.

I know it comes from a good place, or at least I hope so but still... it's creepy as fuck and I'm not sure it should be ok.
