It's never good enough

Just stop before you all start that "You're gonna get better, the future awaits" bullshit. I've posted here twice, once about 2 years ago and I've gotten the same replies, just like those.

Everyone around me bullies the shit out of me, including my family. Not to mention half of them are those racist Neo-Nazi idiots, and I'm done. It's been years since I've tried to commit suicide and nothing has gotten better, only worse.

If you all are gonna say something, say it *now*, because I'm gonna do it. But why the fuck not give this another try, right?
