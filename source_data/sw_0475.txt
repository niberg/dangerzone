Why keep going

I'm without a job and without medical insurance and without money. I need to work immediately. I can't do it until i stop feeling this way. Being alive is so fucking painful. What's the point of all of this?

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Things won't ever it better for me, not like my brain like this.
