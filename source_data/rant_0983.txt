Literary response

I can't think of anything to respond because I can't find anything to respond to. A response requires a call, a question, or something sufficient to respond to. If someone calls out for help, you can respond with help. If someone asks you a question, you can respond with an answer. If someone tells you a story, in the form of a poem for example, you can sit back and say "that's cool" but there's nothing to fucking respond to. I'm not allowed to summarize the poem, and I can't fill a page with bullshit about how he told the story or what literary devices he used or whatever the hell else because that's not a response. Its a report. If that's what you expected then you should have asked for an explication, not a response. A response would be me finding Billy fucking Collins and saying "Hey, I really loved that poem, I found some meaning in it that I think is relevant to my life and the life of everyone else. Thanks for writing it." but I'm not going to write a paper that's actually a letter to Billy Collins praising him for his poetry, because I'm turning it in to you, and you aren't him. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
