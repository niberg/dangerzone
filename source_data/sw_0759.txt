Writing notes made me start to reconsider, but I think it's only a matter of time.

I've been dealing with this shit for a long time.  Really want to shoot myself.  Pills and therapy haven't helped.  Makes me feel even worse that I'm not smart enough to figure out how to beat this and stick around for my friends and family.  I don't want them to have to deal with any more hospitalizations or new medications or false hope that I can be normal.  I feel like an asshole because people love me, but I can't be happy for them and fight to keep on going.
