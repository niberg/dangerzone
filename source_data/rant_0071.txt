A rant about the movie "Frozen" It's message, and it's effect on little girls wanting to be Elsa. *SPOILERS*


First: The first Mistake
They're parents are massively at fault for not taking charge of Elsa's unique qualities. Treating it like a skill that needs to be improved as well as proper use that will show the town that they didn't need to be scared in the first place.

Second: "Let it go" song and meaning
Elsa's careless "letting go" that empowered her so much, (and empowering little girls everywhere) was a product of blissful ignorance. Making a statement, saying you should do whatever you want when you feel the need to "Let it go". At the cost of putting many lives at risk and her responsibilities remaining untouched. This selfish girl builds beauty for herself, unaware that MAKING A CASTLE OF ICE IS AWESOME AND WOULD BE A WELCOMING GIFT TO THE HOMELESS OF HER KINGDOM. Just give them some blankets to go along with it.

Even after learning to use her powers to create beauty it wasn't until her sister DIED IN FRONT OF HER THAT SHE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART AND DECIDED TO NOT BE A BITCH LONG ENOUGH TO MELT THE ICE IN THE WHOLE KINGDOM. Including her dead sister. Whom She killed. Which didn't die. Disney yo

Third: The Sister Anna

I swear that girl was the best thing ever, had her own brain and thought for herself and loving to no end. She gave her own life to save her sister's. She fell in "undying love" with the first nice guy she met. Honestly, isn't that what everyone wants? You meet? You like each other? Awesome, no nonsense, I will love you forever and ever as long as you love me the same. That was her whole demeanor.

EVEN AFTER SHE GOT HER HEART BROKEN BY THE FIRST GUY SHE LET IT GO WITHOUT MAKING A HUGE FUCKING SONG ABOUT IT. 

The whole movie focused on Anna and how she never gave up on her sister, Even after she got MURDERED BY HER. Anna is the disney princess that Elsa wishes she was. 

Fourth: The children

I'm a teacher. In my class I had 3 girls dressed up as Elsa on halloween. 0 Anna's. 

*Side note* I decided to watch this movie after i told my students that I didn't watch it. They suggested that it's the best movie ever, so i decided to watch it. Ugh.

The Pain in my heart that hit me when I finished and processed that movie had me Frozen. hehe. All these little girls are being Elsa's to freeze the world and not care about their destruction as long as they "Let it go" 

Not one Anna to spread the true meaning of love in a whole lifetime. Elsa has seperate isolated incidents of the convenience of love
