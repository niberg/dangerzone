To all you people who got pregnant without even trying...

How did you do it? I'm fucking clueless.  I stopped drinking, I lost weight, I eat super clean, I take pre natal vitamins, I use special shampoo, soap, deodorant, toothpaste, you name it to avoid anything that could hinder my fertility, I buy as much organic stuff as possible, we've tried having sex every day, every other day, caring too much, pretended not to care at all, I've tracked my cycle and still have not managed to get pregnant.  Oh wait, I did and I miscarried! Fuck this shit. Fuck AF. Fuck it all!
