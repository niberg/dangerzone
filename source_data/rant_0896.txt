How hard would it be to put a f*#king slant on the edges of the metal slabs they put down over holes in the street and leave there for weeks on end?!

They always just drop it in place and walk away or they'll pour asphalt around the edge and make speed bumps. As a driver, I find these annoying and they're hell on my poor old suspension. As a cyclist, I find them to be terrifying death traps.

It seems pretty simple to either cut these or shape the mold with a sloped edge. The pick point on only one side would even ensure that they don't drop it upside down. Get it together, street maintenance people!
