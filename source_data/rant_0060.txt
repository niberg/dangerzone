Rant about you.

I'm sorry i hurt you, i promised you i wouldn't and here I am..

I never told you i loved you, because i was afraid to take the next step now i regret never telling you I love you, cause now it looks like i was just one of those guys that you've tried so hard to avoid. 

Our love was something different, that crossed lines and boundaries, alot of people looked at our love as the Forbidden Love.  you came into my life and made me feeling amazing about who i am. Nobody will ever come close to making me feel so wanted and I regret ever letting you go. 

I say bye now knowing you are strong enough to move on with your life, you told me you've finally got your life back together and I am happy for you. I tried to be there whenever you needed me, and I wanted to let you know i was there for you because I cared.

Love you L.

J.
