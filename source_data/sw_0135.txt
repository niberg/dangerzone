Forever alone

After failing driving exam 3 times, I've lost all hope. The laws in EU are crazy, it's been made pretty hard to get a licence, but it seems everyone my age somehow has managed to get one long time ago. It may seem like a silly reason, but I see a car as a must have thing if I don't want to be living alone for the rest of my life. What can I provide to anyone if I'm immobile? Want to take a girl out, use the bus? Pathetic...

I'm utterly disappointed in myself. But deep down I know a car wouldn't make much of a difference. I used to think getting a job would make me happy enough, but it didn't. I see no point in life, it's all so meaningless.

I'm 23 and a very lonely person, I've never even hugged another human being. I suspect I have Asperger syndrome, I seem to lack the ability to socialize with people. I can't even laugh truely, I always fake that and everything else when it comes to social interaction. I've thought about getting a pet, but they're forbidden in most rent apartments and city is not really a proper environment for cats/dogs anyway. 

I've always thought I would not kill myself when my parents are still alive, to not sadden them, but now I don't really care. We're not close anyway. I'm from an atheist country - I don't belive in afterlife, soul or any of that mumbo jumbo. I see death like going to sleep, I wouldn't have to cry about my failures anymore. I've done research and chosen my method years ago, but now I'm more determined. Today I cleaned up my apartment and deleted all porn. My brain keeps telling me there's something I still need to do before doing the deed, but I don't know what it is.

What would you suggest?
