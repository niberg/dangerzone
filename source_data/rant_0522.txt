What's going on in her head?

I work in a small office. My boss hires 2 new people who are fairly new at the work we do. They need training to teach them new stuff and correct bad habits. But every time she sees me over at one of their desks going over something, she always gets angry and tells me to stop wasting time and to just get the work done quickly. Then she walks away angry, ignoring me while I'm trying to tell her that the work is pretty much done, but I'm just going over some minor corrections with them.

Doesn't make sense to me. Actually it's fucking stupid. So you don't teach them, and we're not supposed to ever teach them? Oh ok, that makes much more sense to me.
