Why is life suddenly became sad?

I was happy in my 2nd year of highschool, and suddenly everything turned around. my parents started to scold me about everything, grades, attitude and shit. ive became very emotional, tried to kill myself 2 times this week. The only thing that keeps my happy is netflix and reddit. my step dad is gonna cancel netflix because im using it too much, but its my only escape from all of the emotions in the world. reddit has done a great job making me happy. i cant take it anymore, i didnt really care about posting it on my main instead of a throwaway. thank you guys for a great time. hopefully my netflix account is still open this night(:
