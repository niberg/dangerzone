What is wrong with me?

It seems like every time I meet someone, guy or girl but mostly guys, I have a tendency to drive them away. I know its me. School started 2 months ago and haven't really clicked with anyone. I am a shy dude so that could be the problem and maybe if I gave a shit than I'll probably have a chance with with some one. I'm just sick of being lonely!! And I miss my old friends too!
