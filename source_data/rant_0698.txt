Fuck this #Gamergate bullshit

Seriously, fuck this entire "movement". There hasn't been a single positive thing to come this shit. All that you shitheads have done is harass people for having an opinion. Do you fucking realize that no one would have cared about Anita's videos if you hadn't flipped your shit over what? Someone saying that video games have their issues? I don't give a shit about her kickstarter or whatever, that's not why you're so pissy. You're so attached to this "gamer" label you've attached to yourselves to. Newsflash jackass: IT MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! People with actual shit going on in their lives don't give a fuck about these pointless things.

 And another thing: this "movement" is the most textbook definition of slacktivism I ever seen. For people soooo invested in the "ethics in gaming journalism" you seem to do little in the way of actual protest. Sitting on your ass and retweeting accomplishes nothing. Since when did people give a shit what some douchenozzle reviewer has to say about anything? I hope the "gamer" label dies a quick painful death because it's been tarnished.
