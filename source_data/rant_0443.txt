I'm so hungry, that last $2 was supposed to be for my lunch today

Instead you go out at 9pm and buy this spoiled kid chicken because he refused to eat the dinner that *I* made. You said it's different than what he's used to, he says it's gross. So make him literally ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. WHAT THE FUCK. I'm fucking not going to eat until I get home at 3pm because I gave you the last of my paper money so you could get your caffeine fix, then you pick all our silver change for fucking nothing, IMO. How many fucking people have ever gone to bed without dinner? How many people have fucking died from it? ZERO. LITERALLY NOBODY. YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM SOME GODDAMN SPAGHETTI O'S JFC. Damnit I'm so fucking hungry. I didn't even fucking finish my dinner last night, I didn't have an appetite after that spectacle. This is fucking bullshit. I'm so angry, I just want to cry
