Some people at a certain University are book smart with no life skills.

I was in today doing some work and the majority of the residents can't keep 300 square feet clean, but they're in University. One of the worst today was trying to fit my tiny step stool in a pile of LITERAL garbage. Food, clothes, garbage, more food, more garbage, dirty dishes... How hard is it? How are you not embarrassed? I guess maybe they'll be rich enough to hire a cleaner.

Just ranting by the way, folks. No harm intended.
