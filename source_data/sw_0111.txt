Is there a better option?

I recently made a post about hanging myself. Something happened that stopped me from going ahead with it but I feel like tonight is the night. My question, and I apologise if this isn't allowed here is...Would it be more selfish to hang myself in the woods for some stranger to find or in my own home in my room leaving a note on the door telling my mother not to enter and just call the police....I sound like a selfish shit don't I....Sorry but I think I'm just going to have a cup of tea then head outside for a walk or maybe stay in and do the note on the door option.

I don't know which but I can't stay much longer and just want to get it done.

Messed up scenario.

Thanks for all the replies and PMs last time I posted and recently by the way.

Made my mind up. I'm going for a walk. Thank you for all the help everyone. I hope you all find peace in life that I could not. My note is written my Id is in my pocket, I have my rope and half face mask to not cause too much distress to the person who finds me. 

Sorry, thank you and peace to all.
