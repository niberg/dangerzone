Haters on youtube/what is real music?

What is the purpose of going on youtube videos just to say how something isn't music or how the quality of music is declining with generations? Good and bad music will always be available, you just have to find what you like. Today I was listening to Trap and Moombahton on Youtube and of course, there always have to be one jackass who has to say that this music was made for idiots and that if you like it, then obviously you don't know what "real" music is.

I'm guessing real music is anything made with "real" instruments. But if thats the case, then what defines a real instrument? A lot of synthesizers came to promenince in the 70's and 80's with bands like Electric light Orchestra.

Maybe some of just like music to dance to! We aren't looking for anything with super deep lyrics or some insane solo. Just something to bounce our heads to.
