Please trust my judgement.

It seems each time I make a brief comment to "keep you in the loop" on what I'm doing, you require a further expenditure of time and effort to be brought up to speed on every nuance of the calculus of my decision.  

Not only that, but you seem to take it as an invitation to submit your own unsolicited suggestions, each of which I had already considered and discarded before having arrived at the very solution whose execution you are delaying with your clumsy, misplaced attempt to be involved.  

So in addition to the initial extra time required to provide a general explanation, now I have to give a detailed account of why each of your uninformed suggestions is not the best one. It's as if you don't trust my judgement or you feel I owe you a full reporting of my process.

This would be less infuriating if I had not already diplomatically intimated, implied, hinted, and suggested that you trust my judgement - which has always proven to be solid - in such instances on multiple previous occasions.  

If you want to be in on the decision-making process, then do what I've done: invest enough time to familiarize yourself with all the details of the task then proceed to logically eliminate options until you've reached the best solution. It's not my job to do all the work then painstakingly report it to you for your approval, as though you're the CEO of a company paying me a fat salary.  

It kills my drive and efficiency when I have to take on the additional workload of explaining everything.  

The only reason I ever say anything to you in the first place is out of a desire to be communicative and inclusive, rather than retreating to a dark, quiet corner of the house to do my work efficiently and in peace.
