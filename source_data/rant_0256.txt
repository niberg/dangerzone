Rant about Roommates!

This really grinds my gears!!! I am hormonal due to pregnancy so I am probably making a big deal out of nothing but here we go.

So this tale begins today at 1pm. I was downstairs making myself lunch and doing the dishes. While I was waiting for the food to finish I was unpacking the dishwasher 'enter roommate'. As I was putting away the last of the dishes she says "Oh, Don't worry about the ones in the sink. I will do them before I leave for work because I don't have to go till 5." So at this point I thank her, pack my lunch and head out the door for work. My fiance was home from work and it is now 9pm. I asked him out of curiosity if the sink is still full of dishes and it was. 

My issue here is I was already doing them and would have finished if you didn't offer. Don't say you are going to do something and then not. This is one of my biggest pet peeves and why I don't expect anyone to do shit. People like you ruin how I feel about humanity and roommates. AHHHHHHH!

Well I feel better. Thank you to those who read this.
