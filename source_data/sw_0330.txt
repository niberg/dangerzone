Evenings are the worst. [M 19]

I'm not actively planning on suicide or anything, but I'm just here to talk about my passive sucide thoughts.

I've had them for as long as I can remember, I think they started on age 14, that's when I cut myself. I was bullied in primary school for my weight and that still hurts today at 19 y/o. I still see myself as disgusting and fat even though I'm apparently at a healthy weight. 

My evenings, especially in the winter, are the worst on my suicidal thoughts. They're always there, and I can't function normally anymore because of them. I hate myself, I hate my looks, I hate my 'skills', I hate everything about myself. Next up, I'm comparing myself to my friends and I start crying because I'm not even close to their 'cool' lives.

I'm just afraid my thoughts might go to action anytime soon, and I was hoping to get some advice here...

I posted earlier on /r/depression too but got [no response](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2lb5cv/unloved_unwanted_untalented_and_uninteresting/). That post is a bit more in-depth.
