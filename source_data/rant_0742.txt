Bloody parking fees

I hate how much they charge for being able to park your car. The whole idea of having to pay for my car to be stationary in one place for a few hours is ridiculous. Don't we pay enough in excise taxes for gas and oil to cover the costs of maintaining the parking spaces?

Oh wait. It's not that we pay for the infrastructure. We also have to feed people who sit on their sorry (or sore even, for sitting for so long) asses, and have no understanding of how expensive parking the car downtown is because:

1. They have a guaranteed place in their workplace free of charge.
2. They can afford it much easier than ~80% of people who use their cars for daily home to work commuting.

That's one of the reasons I hate my city for. This is why we can't have nice things and will be cursed with a label of a typical place for nouveau riches or people who only pursue money in their life for years to come. Unless the entire country will have a sudden explosive growth.
