What's with all my snarky professors?!

I pay a small fortune at a gross intrest rate to attend my school that I guess requires their professors to pass an asshole test before they can be hired. I'm not a slacker by any means and I work really hard on my assignments, I get awesome grades, never miss class, I'm also POLITE to every one of my professors! I have only ever once been harsh to one but he also called me an idiot for not understanding a procedure that he half assed explained and wasn't in our book. But now I have one who told the class if we argue about a question we'll get a zero on our midterm? I'm sorry but that's horrible! What if someone has a genuine question or concern where the way a question was written directly goes against what we covered in lecture? Even the fucking book says you are wrong! I had to email the person who is in charge of my lab instructor because I simply brought my book up and asked why it conflicted with the question, I didn't have a rude tone it was a simple question that I thought maybe could be explained as to why the discrepancy. I didn't expect a super bitchy uncaring and unhelpful response, the person in charge of them also gave me the same shitty response after I wrote out a well thought out email, no fucking answers still just shitty attitudes. Now I have to worry that I'll be graded like shit for questioning them, and literally no one will answer my simple fucking question. I can't wait to graduate this year, this school is terrible and a good portion of the professors as well. Why go into teaching if you don't fucking care if we understand anything?
