Why is this concept so hard to grasp?

I don't understand.

* There ≠ **Their**
* Then ≠ **Than**
* Could/Should/Would of ≠ Could/Should/Would **have**
* To ≠ **Too** or **Two**
* Affect ≠ **Effect**
* Your ≠ **You're**
* A ≠ **An**


I mean come on people. Also you need to stop adding periods at the ends of your sentences if you're not going to spell correctly or ***capitalize***. There's also no need for your stupid fucking **extra** periods.
