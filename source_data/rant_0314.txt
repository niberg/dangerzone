The guy who flipped a coin at a hobo saying "catch!" with a belittling smile on his face: fuck you.

He's the type of hobo who the locals have embraced; he's always there, and there's always someone sitting next to him, keeping him company; someone like a local shop owner, young folk, etc.

He just likes to sit there, watch people, sip from his beer, have his smoke, write poetry and carve wood. Not quite stable in the mind (speaks to himself often) but completely harmless.

So today, while I was passing by him, he jokingly said "such a high pedestrian traffic, and *no one* has any spare change?". Don't get me wrong; he'll use that to buy more beer anyway, and it's just obvious.

But even this guy, this half-crazy drunk hobo who has already thrown pride out the window a long time ago, gave the saddest "smile" and head-nod I've ever seen from him when that other guy just flipped the coin, as if throwing biscuits at a dog.

I'll buy you a 6-pack of beer next time around, hobo!
