hello 15 year old facing really though time looking for advice

Hello everyone. I am 15 and I want to commit Suicide, let me start off by saying that I am not doing this for attention but honestly I have no one else to talk to. I have no friends/girl friend  I guess I'm pretty popular at school but I don't think anyone actually likes me. It's cause I annoy everyone around me. Anyway yeah usually when I come home I end up sleeping and generally just tired of ways being alone and un attractive. My mom is the only person I have and she is the only reason I don't want to commit suicide. I can't imagine making her life already worse that it is. Ok so I also think I has some sort of mental illness because I tend to over react and over think some simple stuff. Like for example I told the girl I wanted to ask to homecoming(already past I just wanted to let her know how I felt) how I felt and as said if was adorable and cute and I texted her today and she hasn't responded all I said was hey. (she has read recites on) i know I shouldn't feel this way but I feel like I'm not even worth a response... Anyway I just don't see a point to living any longer. I am fat. I don't have a dad. I don't have any friends. I am always alone. I am tired of living if you have any advice I would appreciate it. I just need someone to talk to
