I don't have a talent. I am not unique. I like unique things. I am alone. I have no purpose.

I have friends in Asia who I talk to every single day. I have no friends near where I live. I have no physical contact. I feel like a useless piece of shit who is just rotting, slowly and slowly. I don't want to pull the trigger but my brain is telling me to end everything. One of the friends in Asia likes me a lot and I like her, but I don't know what to do since I have so much pressure over the next two years to perform. If I don't perform I will surely die.
