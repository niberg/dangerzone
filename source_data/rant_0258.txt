Sorry...

you're like their sister subreddit... the christians... who's brothers subreddits a politic. .. we're all siblings here, brother and sister. My cousin! He was somebody I once considered a brother. my cousin. The other man who once called me my brother.. I have 3. 

I'm going to vote this morning... (or at least I was going to early vote... but they shut me down... damn before 12 O'clock... noon people.) I'm speaking about the moon people. Now if you'll carry on. I will vote, but not for republican. Now understand me not, but it isn't for you, its for the other people. its other people, the other people. I am not perfect, I know, but my vote will consist of all the things I've voted for, that's why I'm not going to vote tomrrow... just like this morning. when I did vote. for early voting... k now this doesn't make sense, I said I did vote to have early voting, but now, I'm talking to a world consistent with adults. There are plenty of you here, but you're all part of reality. If I wanted to listen to any oof one of you in particular... Who was I voting for? Oh yeah. That other guy. The dems may had knows him. HAd known him, the democrats. They're republicans, just like my parents. but, I don't know how to say that. 

I'm of democratic oath. I want the protect you. protext, you, and brotext you. Brosetf. Yes, I'm speaking in crazy again, I do that, I get there. but the important part is when you know why ther real world and the real world are serious. beacusae, sometimes it's real. there. really there. You're silly there, me? Who did I want to claim to be galking about ealier? And who are you gawking at as I had spelt galkked abouted. 

(I'll probably write yes or no according to either option, then I'll say yes again, just like I said no...w again.
