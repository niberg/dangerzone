"How's the job search going?"

Hey, instead of making that the subject of every conversation we have, why don't we talk about something that doesn't make me immensely uncomfortable? It's going fucking terribly, by the way, which you should have been able to infer from my lack of emphatic declaration of my employment. Seriously, I will fucking tell you when I'm hired you dense sons of bitches.

Oh, and your 'helpful tips and suggestions' are not wanted nor needed. 'So and so business just opened up-' yeah, I know. I knew 2 months ago when they started hiring, I went to their job fair. I also applied to every other business you're suggesting and I don't even know why you're suggesting them. Do you think I'm too dumb to read the paper, check online, or just fucking ask around? 

I'm working with an employment agent from a government program. They offer cash incentives to hire people in their programs and I have to work through them in order to qualify, so no I'm not going to do things 'the old fashioned way' because it's very clear IT DOESN'T WORK. 
I'm so so so sick of having this same conversation every goddamn time I see you people. I'm fucking trying! Do you think I like being broke and unemployed? Ever time you bring it up and push the subject I just want to scream and cry and run into the mountains. I live no where near any mountains, I'd be running for a very long time.

Just shut up. I'll tell you when I get a job, I'll tell you if there's anything new in my life. Stop asking me.
