Idiot scammers

At the library with my kids, we have a weekly story time.    We live in an upper-middle class neighborhood with an awesome school system -- I'm normally the only white guy there (asians and indians).    So this time I was surprised to see another white couple, and they even looked like they were struggling financially a little -- but their two little kids are bright and really enjoyed the story time.     Afterwards, I was sitting and reading with my daughter when the "mom" was talking loudly on her cell phone nearby... "But I don't have enough money for gas.   No, he doesn't either, we had enough to get to the library.  Also little billy is hungry, he hasn't eaten since lunch.   If you could bring me some cash I'd appreciate it.  You can't?   What am I going to do?  No, it's not your fault, we'll figure out something. "     

All of this was clearly designed for me to hear it and for me to feel sorry for her.   But her conversation was kind of unnatural, there was too little space for response between her comments on the phone -- and when she "hung up", she didn't press any buttons and the screen was dark.  

 She sort of stood there for a second, looking like she was about to cry.   Glanced over at me.   I shrugged.   She walked away.  15 minutes later I'm walking out and from a distance I witness the entire display again, exact same fake phone call, same exasperated behavior, her kids were there with her, as was her husband.     She didn't get any bites that time either.

Seriously... using your kids to scam people?   I wanted to say something but I was with my kids and didn't want to start a confrontation in the middle of the library.
