I'm Scared

I have severe major depressive disorder and severe (social) anxiety. I have attempted suicide once before (a few months ago), but last night was the closest that I have ever come to dying. I had a roommate who watched me through the night, who made sure that I was breathing, laid me on my side and made sure I wasn't going to die. He didn't know that I wrote a suicide note. I'm so tired. I'm so scared. I told my family, I told my girlfriend. I'm afraid that this behavior will lose them. It makes me even more depressed and embarrassed that I have to even tell them that I tried to end my life. I am in my fourth year of college with the credits of a sophomore, and have taken a medical leave of absence. Every day I feel like I can barely take care of myself, much less be a loving presence in someone else's life. I feel inadequate. I feel so ... terminally sad. I don't know what to do. I am on medication, I have a psychiatrist and I've been on every pill on the books. I feel hopeless. Sometimes I feel like things would be easier if I no longer had to worry about them. I'm just so sad. I don't know if it is even worth continuing.
