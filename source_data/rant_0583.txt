FML, I've got things looming over me and I'm fucking done keeping it in the bottle.

Besides my normal life issues (meds, mood swings, lack of a job, etc) I am dealing with possibly being sent to jail because of some fucking bitch taking over my dad's life, house, and most likely bank accounts. This woman has been trouble from day one and honestly has it out to get me.

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!
