A voice in my head

He said he really loves me for who I am and that I am beautiful no matter what. No matter what I look like now or in the future, whether I gain or lose weight or the youthfulness of my looks, there won't be an inch that he doesn't love about me. He loves every hair on my skin, not just the hair on my head. He loves how I feel under his touch and the way I look up to him in adoration. He promised he won't leave and will be right beside me whenever I need him. He'll be there to comfort me.    
That doesn't really cut it. I still feel miserable. Will this pain and longing ever go away? If his endless love can't dry my tears, I don't know what else will. I suffer knowing that 'he' is gone.
