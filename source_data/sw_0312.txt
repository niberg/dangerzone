The heaviness is suffocating any rational thoughts.

I have had years if abuse and illness that have shown me how dark and merciless this world can be. The only people I have still in my life are those I would do anything for,  but unfortunately don't feel they'd say the same for me. The people I get the courage to open up to still only seem to care about what I can do for them instead of what they can ever do for me. I always am the shoulder to cry on but no one ever offers me theirs. I broke down and called a suicide hotline after desperately searching for someone to talk to. The lady who answered started asking me questions and somehow got into a conversation about her own daughter. Cut to me giving the suicide hotline lady advice, and feeling like this all has to be some sick joke. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is because I know it would hurt my family if I was gone. But I only think it would hurt them because then they wouldn't have me to be their cheerleader/therapist/punching bag. This is the only reason I haven't just overdosed, and everyday it sounds like a worse reason than the day before. Please help me. If you can. If you care. I'm sure you don't.
