Have you NEVER been to a wedding before?!

I'm getting married this weekend...and the VOLLEY of micro-level questions coming at me every fifteen minutes is mind boggling. My parents keep calling me and we have conversations such as:

- Parents: "Now...when people drive into the winery, how will they know where to park?"

- Me: "What? There's a parking lot. There's only ONE way to go...STRAIGHT into the parking lot."

- Parents: "Right, maybe you should think about hiring someone to stand in the driveway to tell people where to park."

- Me: "What the hell?! I'm not paying someone to tell people 'Please drive straight ahead!'"

- Parents: "Now...what will people do if they arrive early?"

- Me: "How early do you think people are going to show up?!"

- Parents: "Oh, you know...say...half an hour early. What will they do?"

- Me: ".............they'll wait. What else would they do?"

- Parents: "Well is there someplace for them to go? Or will they need to take their seats right away?"

- Me: "What? I don't know! They can do whatever the hell they want! The wedding starts at 5! Until then they can do anything! Everyone coming is an ADULT and everyone of them has been to a wedding!! It's not like we're going to have ARMED GUARDS shooting at people if they wander into the wrong area...! We all just went to a wedding last month and we showed up early...what did WE do?!"

- Parents: "Well we waited....but..."

- Me: "No! No buts! You wait! If it's hot out, you wait in the shade! Or wait in your car! Or wait in the main building! We've been to DOZENS of weddings in our lifetime! And all of THOSE went smoothly! GET OFF MY CASE!"
