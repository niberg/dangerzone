I have been on and off suicidal for the past few years, how can i stop this cycle?

Im debating on killing myself. Ive been holding a knive to my jugulars for the past half hour... 

It seems like anything that can push me hard enough into a bad mood will do this. 

Im a freshmen in college, the first few weeks were fun but now i feel very alone and without many friends. Im sitting alone in my room reading reddit instead of going out to a halloween party like i wanted.  People on my hall that i am sort of friends with went out and didnt even think to invite me. I have zero potential with girls around here, no one that im even talking to, and i got no matches with anyone within 100 miles on tinder, i deleted my facebook and the app after that.

This is the second time in two weeks ive thought of killing myself.

When i think about it this is probably moderate-serious depresion or some kind of bipolar thing going on, i seem okay for a while but then something sets me off and im depressive, asocial, and suicidal.

Im probably going to go sit in the bathroom shower and cry now, ill have my phone to read responses... :/
