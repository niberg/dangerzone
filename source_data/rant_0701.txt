I don't want to look for nursing jobs anymore...

I've just finished four years of nursing school. Four of the fucking toughest years I've ever lived. Nursing school is hard, and the disorganization of nursing schools in general only makes it harder. But I'm done, so now it is time to get an awesome job, right?

Wrong.

Apparently the state of teaching in nursing schools is so bad that four years of training isn't enough to land a simple entry level nursing job. I'd say 75% of the entry level jobs I look at say "New Grads not considered". Another 10% imply that they are willing to consider new grads, but will probably hire someone with experience. That leaves me with about 5% of jobs that don't really address it. Are they willing to consider me, or did they just forget to put "new grads need not apply"? 

What the hell did I pay for? I would have been better off volunteering at a hospital trying to do more and more things. 

I can (and am) try to get into a new grad program, but they generally don't start for months. Also, a local hospital had a new grad program try out last year for 40 positions... they got 600 applicants. 


Finally... I resent that all my life experience makes no matter when applying to jobs. I may not have prior medical experience, but I have fucking loads of life experience working in high stress/high pressure jobs. Give me a month or two in a hospital and I will be an amazing employee... not that anyone will give me that chance. 


Edit: I suppose this isn't so much a rant as a deflating.
