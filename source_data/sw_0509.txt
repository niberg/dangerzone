So how does this work exactly

I've been dreaming more often lately. I don't understand them but they make me feel something. Even the ones where I'm distressed make me happy. Happier at least.

Do I come here to complain about my issues? Does someone come and tell me that it'll get better? It might, but I'm a selfish person. I want it better now. I don't believer certain people were made for this world. There should be other places for people like me. But there is none. I don't see another choice.
