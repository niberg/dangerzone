I have two hours left in my weekend and I have to spend it with people I hate.

So my girlfriend and I spend the better part of Saturday and the morning of Sunday together. Then we agreed I'd go spend some time with my friends, while she was going to watch a play and go to a friend's birthday party. After our individual engagements, we were supposed to meet at her place to sleep together before going to our respective jobs on Monday.

My rendezvous with my friends ended early, and I made the mistake of texting her. Now she wants me to go to the birthday party, which consists basically of friends of her of which I am not particularly fond, at a bar that I loathe. This was never part of the plan, and definitely not how I intended to spend the rest of my Sunday. I'm not a very sociable person, and being around strangers is taxing for me. It takes energy and concentration to cope with the situation, which at the moment I lack. If I go, I'll be at a low-energy level and not be able to interact much. If I don't go, I'm a shitty boyfriend.

Of course I'll go, because I understand there are social obligations with which I must comply, but I needed to get this off my chest first.
