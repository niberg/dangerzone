How can I make it look like an accident?

Please don't try and stop me, I honestly can't see my future ending any other way then me killing myself. 

I'm 17, a senior in high school, don't drive yet, and I don't want to traumatize anyone by throwing myself in front of a train or something. What could be a fast way to end it all without making it look like I committed suicide?
