SO dropped the ball on Halloween candy

This is a very minor annoyance, but I just had to get it out because he's not responding to my texts. I had a long meeting today and realized we didn't have enough Halloween candy for tomorrow, so I asked him to get more. I knew he wouldn't think of it (ADHD) so I **SPECIFICALLY TOLD HIM** that it needed to be individually wrapped. I don't know if he didn't understand what that meant or just forgot (likely the latter - again, ADHD), but he brought home a shitton of unwrapped bulk candy. I don't know how much money he wasted on this but it looks like a lot, and that really irritates me. On the plus side, we now have candy forever for ourselves, but now I need to take time out of my lunch tomorrow (when I was supposed to be working on a budget proposal) to buy more expensive wrapped candy at the grocery store. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH ok I'm done
