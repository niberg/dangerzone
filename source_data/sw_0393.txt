Always contemplating

I think about it every day now. Trying to decide which way I want to go. I've been tormented by my own thoughts for almost 6 years now. I've already been put in the psych ward once and I don't want to ever go back again. 

I'm  not sure when, or even if I'll ever take my own life, but that doesn't stop me from always thinking about it.
