God dammit EA

You fucking assholes. For over 3 hours now, I've kept trying and kept TRYING to buy Titanfall. Every god damn time, all I got was the error code 10048. Every. Effing. time. Don't you want my money? Jesus dicks. Your tech support was no help either.

I know it sounds silly to get so upset over this, but I'm at my wits end. Fix your shitty-ass program, EA.
