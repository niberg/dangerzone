How do you guys keep going?

Im typically an optimistic person. Ive been diagnosed with bpd and anxiety a while back and lately its gotten so bad from personal life stress and work that Ive started to resort to self harm, something I haven't done in years. I want hope that Ill be okay but Im not so sure I will be anymore.
