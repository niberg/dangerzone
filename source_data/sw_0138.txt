Not really sure what do.

Sorry for the disorganized rant in advance. I am a 19 year old woman who is transgender, living away from home at college. I've had fantasies about suicide since I was probably in 7th grade, before I even knew that I was trans. When I came out I moved to a new place and finally started presenting the manner in which I saw myself, I thought it would get better, and parts have, but not nearly enough. People stare at me on the streets, I get disgusted looks, when I look in the mirror I can't  see a woman, I just see a man in drag looking back at me, I hate it. I hate myself. I've been able to suppress urges to kill myself for a long time, but it's slowly becoming all I can think about anymore. My grades have been dropping and I have almost no motivation to do anything any more. Really, the main reason I haven't attempted is because I know it would ruin my mother and my boyfriend, and I really, really don't want to hurt them. I know they've both expressed suicidal tendencies before, and I don't want them to follow me down. But still, the temptation won't go away, and every day it's getting stronger and stronger. I suppose it's relevant to mention that my family on both sides has very high rates of suicide and depression, I think I'm hard-wired to hate myself or be depressed or whatever. I don't know. Sorry, just needed to vent, I guess.
Edit: Oops, fucked up the title. Oh well.
