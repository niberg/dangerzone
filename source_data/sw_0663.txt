Shared the fact that I was having suicidal thoughts with mom's boyfriend. Not a good idea.

So, the last month has been rough for me.  Really rough.  My mom's boyfriend doesn't have a job, and has been at the house for a pretty long time.  He always offers to talk and help, which was nice before.  But today he started lying to my mother and family, saying that he "tackled me to the floor in an attempt to stop me from leaving and killing myself."  He described it in vivid detail, and twisted both his words and mine.  Finally, he called one of his friends at a local psych ward and is attempting to have me committed with this story as evidence.


Word of warning to those seeking help here: share your feelings with someone, but not everyone.
