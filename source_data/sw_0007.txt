I keep thinking of committing suicide

So for a while now I've been constantly daydreaming of suicide.  I catch myself in class thinking of jumping of the golden gate bridge.  I have a privileged life and a great group of friends that I'm constantly having a fun time with.  I don't get why I have this obsession with offing myself... every time im alone in my thoughts im planning out my own suicide and it bothers me.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I have no intention do it right now but I have this nagging feeling that my death will be by my own hands.
