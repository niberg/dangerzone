I'm so sad and tired.

Last year I tried to kill myself. Every time I think I'm doing better it doesn't last. I usually end up feeling worse than before. I'm just so tired of everything. I'm tired of not having friends, of being anxious all the time, having terrible nightmares. The list goes on and on. I'm just starting to feel like it's not worth the fight anymore.
