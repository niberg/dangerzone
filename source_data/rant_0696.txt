Shortest Rant I Can Manage

Nobody wants to fucking talk to me and it's driving me *fucking* crazy!

Where do people go to do things in real life anyway, don't you need to have friends to go with you or something so you don't look/feel like a fucking loser. I just sit in my room on my computer all day and pretend I don't feel like crying.
