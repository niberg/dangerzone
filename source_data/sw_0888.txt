If I don't accomplish my goals in the next three years I'm going to commit suicide.

I have to say that I am not depressed. I might be a bit annoyed at myself at the moment, but I'm currently in school and doing pretty bad at math. I want to go into physics, and honestly the only reason I see to be alive is to work in the sciences. I've thrown at least 10 hours+ a day into study, and am still doing bad. I don't have family or loved ones, and am for the most part alone all the time, which I prefer to being around people. I wouldn't say I have social anxiety, but I don't care much for being around people. I just can't handle doing bad in school, especially when I'm pouring so much into it.

Yes I go to professors and try to get help at the various places that the school offers. I'm active, and generally I have uplifted spirits, although I don't feel up right now, I wouldn't say I feel sad right now either.

Edit: Thanks for the replies
