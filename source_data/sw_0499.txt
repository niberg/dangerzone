Tell me why this bullshit is worth living through.

I'm over no matter what I do its critiqued.  I'm over the supposed problem I have. 

Yes I drink.... But she nic picks at me over nothing to start a fight and blames me. 

I can't do it.  I can't deal with all the lies. 

I'm not gonna do it tonight by if I find a bullet and a gun.  I'm done.
