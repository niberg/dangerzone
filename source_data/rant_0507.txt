So because he cheated or whatever im the one whos a punching bag?

Your boyfriend broke up with you or decided to cheat. Whatever, what do I have to do with anything. I try to stau out of the whole thing cause heaven forbid anyone tell you anything about uou being wrong 

Yes I understand all you believe in is the eye for an eye bullshit. Guess what life dosent work that way. You bitch and moan about x y z, but have no balls to follow through. How are you going to write a rext to send to people that literally do not have anything to do with your situation. 

I mean your sending a text to what his parents? HE IS 24 YEARS OLD. YOU ARE 21 YEARS OLD. Start showing it. I dont understand how she even made it in life with this attitude. Oh and if you think sending a message about something that has been apologized about numerous times and the fact that it was (tried to be at first) proven.

If all you say is nobody proves a friendship nobody will! No one is going to try to prove something if you wont even let them. I mean what kind of hypocritical shit is that? How can I prove something like uou tell me to AND YOU WONT EVEN LET ME DO IT.  Its half backwards. 

He cheated on you for this very reason.  You want the proof, won't let ot be proven then get mad when it dosent get proven. Allow it to happen and if one mistake happens boom princess dosent want it anymore. The fuck. How can anyone do anything if it ain't going to be allowed. 

I mean I try to help and prove this friendship that you so want me to prove because a joke warrants a physical punch in the breast. But if I warn you not to say A SINGLE WORD about my half sister AND my mother (whom I would love to see rot in a sack) because I was going to hit her. 

How are you going to hold for a near month about me hitting you after you were warned about it as apposed to a joke and a physical hit? Is this what is reduced from our friendship if that is what you call it.
