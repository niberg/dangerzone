Money, why can't I keep you??

It's my own fault I can't afford things. I'm too generous with my spending. Now when there's things I need, I can't afford them. My truck needs a new windsheild, it rattles when I go in-town speeds, it also needs new tires, and of fucking course it's practically winter here so don't have much time on that one. And I mean, I love helping others out. I don't regret donating money anywhere, for anything, but I just wish I thought things through more. And on supremely selfish note, fricken One Direction tickets are now selling, and I can't afford one. I swore I would set myself on fire if I couldn't go, and here I am! Happy as a clam in the world of donations, but goddamnit I'm just so flustered when it comes to everything else.
