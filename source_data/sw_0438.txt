Tired.

Depressed, suffering from paranoia, having carefully designed the way to go for me, but couldn’t do it because it would be “irresponsible”. Now I'm a soulless walking corpse, serving my time and gazing into the darkness that seems will never end.
I envy those who at least have chosen a date.
