My cousin committed suicide two days ago.

Hi, everyone. I'm not sure if any of you know or have read /u/beccamalfoy 's posts in this subreddit. I made this account to post here. I'm absolutely devastated. She was like a sister to me and I didn't know it was this bad for her. I knew she was struggling with depression...but I didn't know it was this bad. I feel so inincredibly guilty! She was only 19...I'm just at a loss for words right now. I can't even begin to imagine the kind of pain she went through to resort to this. I shouldve tried harder to help her. She had so much going for her...she's an amazing artist, and such a great writer...jesus. i keep hoping that this is all a lie and I'll get a call from her telling me it's a prank. She can't be gone. She just can't. I don't know what or who to believe. Please,  somebody help me! I just need answers....
