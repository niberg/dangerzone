I think I want to end my life.

Over the past 1.5 months I've had the following happen:

- Military start the process to kick me out after 7 years of service, because I started taking prescribed adderal for ADHD.

- Girlfriend broke up with me.

- Lost out on my job offer for my dream job that I've wanted since I was a child because of a bullshit evaluation. 

What is the point of even being alive anymore?
