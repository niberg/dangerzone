90%+ of my life is made up of stress and pain. I'm pretty sure it'll only get worse.

Got caught cheating on a minor college assignment and I still don't know what will happen because of that. I've basically been laying in bed all day stressing I'll get expelled or fail the course as punishment. Oh, and the best part, I've got 2 extremely hard midterms tomorrow (in courses that I'm passing by a % or 2) that I have not studied for, my chest literally hurts from stress. Um what else, oh... My car broke down today, my dog tried to attack another dog on a walk, and to top it all off I stepped in another dog's shit. Probably one of the worst days of my life. My entire body is aching, I can barely walk or breathe. All my life I've had terrible anxiety around people, so my social life is as bad or even worse than my academic life right now. I don't know how I'll be able to face my parents if my punishment is severe. I want to die. I don't see why I should live anymore. I mean, we all die eventually, right? What's the point? Why should I endure this pain for another 60+ years? My entire life up until this point has been complete, painful shit. I've been a failure at everything I tried, and am no use to this world.


Heh, look at me... Posting this on the internet for attention.. I'm pathetic head to toe. Should I just end it all? I am a hopeless, useless lost cause. Death will be so peaceful.
