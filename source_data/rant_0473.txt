You're a disgrace.

Your uncle has lived most of his years with mental illnesses, you probably couldn't even attempt to imagine how his life was/is like. Every time you'd see him, you wouldn't even try to fake a smile or try to show him that you are family. He wasn't stupid either, I'm sure he seen it. 

You never wanted to visit, see, eat or even talk with him. And it doesn't end there, you act like that in front of many members of your family, your cousins, aunts. They're your blood as we say, and a life is not worth living without family, right? And you know you'll never forget those words. 

And quite frankly, I hate you. I can't stand you, there is not a single thing that is not repulsive about you... about me...
