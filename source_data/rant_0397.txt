You're blaming me, because of the unit I was in?

I was in the Marine Corps for 11 years. I was stationed at Abu Ghraib for 5 of those years, as part of an Army detachment. The things I fucking saw. I witnessed two soldiers force a man to stand for 72 hours on end, while they periodically whipped him in the stomach with hoses filled with sand. I saw men and women in uniform terrorize prisoners with fucking massive dogs just because they could. I saw a 12-13 year old boy sodomized by a female soldier, while other soldiers laughed, holding dogs on leashes. I was one of those men in uniform. I was fucking powerless.
