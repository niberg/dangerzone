My excuse is wearing thin.

For the past few years, I've said that the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is for my mother's sake. I don't want her to have to bury her own child. But it's getting to the point where I don't even care about that. I'm extremely unintelligent, uncreative and unable to function as a normal human being in any setting. I have constant thoughts and fantasies about killing myself.

I'm I'm honest, there are two major reasons for why I really don't do it.

One, I was raised in a Southern Baptist church and I fear going to Hell. I've since become an atheist, but because of the psychological abuse that is religion, I can't shake this fear that I'm wrong and that I'll go from relatively minor earthly suffering to an eternal of 24 hour brutal punishment for all of eternity.

Two, fear of pain, during the attempt and after. I don't self-harm because I have a very low tolerance for pain and get sick to my stomach when I think about cutting or otherwise hurting myself. I need to find a method that's quick, reliable and clean, but I'm not intelligent or resourceful enough to find such a method.

In the end, I feel like I'm starting to hate my mother. She shouldn't have been so irresponsible and had a child out of wedlock and knowing she had mental health issues. I never should have been born, and if there is a god, he had no right creating me without my consent.

I guess I'm just venting at this point, or maybe trying to talk myself out of or into something.
