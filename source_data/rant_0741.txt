Dad, FUCK you.

Fuck you dad. Fuck you for ignoring me when i tell you about an insight i had.

Fuck you for telling me about every woman you've had a crush on while you're still married to my mom.

Fuck you for filling my head with all the disgusting stories about my mom's rape.

Fuck you for not listening to me.

Fuck you dad. You're a child and i know this but FUCK YOU.

You never addressed your trauma and you were never a father. FUCK YOU for being so stuck in your own head that you can't even deal with a positive insight. FUCK YOU.

I hate you for being such a child. You're fucking 64 years old and you still regard me as a friend, a buddy. So you get to tell me all the gory details about what you did but i don't get to share my positive stories or my sadness.

FUCK YOU. 

I wish i could tell you this, but you recently had an operation so i have to spare you (my moms words)

FUCK YOU. YOU HAVE NO IDEA what you did to me. FUCK YOU.

And i can't even tell you cos of your fucking heart.

Fuck you. 

You should've never had a kid. Fuck you for not knowing who you are. And fuck you, fuck you cos i had to figure it all out myself. Fuck you for never talking to me, fuck you for never listening to me, fuck you for never protecting me.

You're an idiot. And i hate you dad.

But i love the little boy you are.
