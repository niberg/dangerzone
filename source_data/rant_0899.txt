My monthly healthcare insurance premium is $806. This is nonsense.

I am on my wife's employers' plan. $403 is deducted for my portion every 2 weeks which comes out to $806 a month or $9,672 a year.

That's right. $806 a month for MY portion. It's a Texas Blue Cross PPO plan, standard 80/20 with $3000 individual/$6000 family deductible and $40 office visits.

We don't qualify for any subsidies or tax credits. We do get to take medical deductions on our 1040 but that is not the same  as a credit. It is not a reasonable premium. We aren't rich or wealthy. But I have to have insurance due to a pre-existing condition. I shudder to think what the premium will be next year.
