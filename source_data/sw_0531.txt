Why not?

I have a friend who is suicidal. She has many problems. Her dad left her family when she was young. Her mom and her always fight and argue and never get a long, and I am not exaggerating by using the word never. She is addicted to pills and has bad lungs from smoking cigarettes so often. She is trying to quit pills and cigarettes but is having trouble. She has done cocaine and still does do it once every other week or so. She is convinced that she is ugly, and even though I tell her she's not, she doesn't believe me. Not to sound heartless, but she is, though not overweight, even though she thinks she is a overweight and starves herself and used to make herself throw up. She is convinced her boyfriend is just using her for sex and always lies to her. I don't think he is but am starting to since he is a senior and she is a freshman. Her mom and her and her little sister aren't broke but are poor (can afford food and the essentials but not fancy clothes or stuff like that). She gets terrible grades and is always getting in trouble at school, and even though I say it's important she says she doesn't care. When she was convinced she would kill herself and I told her not to, she asked why not. I couldn't think of a reason. I said stuff like your mom and sister would miss you, but she said that wasn't true, and is right, her mom said she wished she would overdose and die. She has no real friends besides me and knows it. She said I'm the only reason she doesn't. But why shouldn't she? What can I say to her to convince her not to?
