Burnt out on life

I just can't figure out what to do anymore. I was going to post a long schpeel describing what exactly is gimped about my life, but the list is too long, and considering nobody will see this or reply, I won't bother. Long story short, it's modern-day white people problems. 


My motto for 2014, and what I hope they'll carve right on my goddamn gravestone when they bury my charred corpse; FUCK EVERYBODY.
