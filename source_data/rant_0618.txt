Women belong at home in the kitchen, government entitlements are running the US into the ground, and having an abortion condemns you to hell. You've heard it all before. Commiserate with me?

My dad’s one of those hard-core patriarchs that thinks the "solution" to the (I’m quoting here) “baby mamas” who eat lobster and steak for free off the government’s food stamps because of her 12 kids is to cut the entitlements programs in half, which would force them to actually “go out and get a man” so the man can work and get the family money and they can stay home with the kids but they “don’t want to do that because then the government won’t give them any money, or at least not as much” so they tell their “baby daddies” to go away and get out of there and not marry them.   

Seriously. This is what he actually believes. And he thinks that his "solution" will solve the “problem” of “little boys growing up to be thugs in gangs and pimps” because they don’t have a “father figure”.   

Ugh. There are so many things with this argument I want to hurl.  

And he believes abortion is “murder” and “God has a special place in hell for [the women who have abortions]” and I asked him about ‘what if she was raped’ and…and he said it doesn’t matter, that she should have it anyway and if she doesn’t want it she should give it up for adoption. It doesn't matter that a woman's body is changed forever after having a child. It doesn't matter that she doesn't want a child and probably never did.   

I just.   
I have two younger brothers who are too little to not think that the word of dad is not gold and there’s nothing I can do about what he’s telling them and…   
Ugh.  

I know the comment section will probably be a shitstorm, but please respond with your thoughts, whether you agree with either or neither of us.
