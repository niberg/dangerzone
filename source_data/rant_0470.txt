Reddit does not like "New"

Maybe it's a difference between English and Americans. I dunno.

I recently posted a comment to a thread which distinctly said something was "new. The general reply had the theme "Well, if it was new, there was probably something before."

Apparently Reddit hated this logic. Within 10 minutes it had -10 karma, so I wasn't willing to keep that going.

But really? People didn't like it that much, during the score hidden time too? And so I wonder if it was a separation between English and US speaking.

For example. In England, when you get your first car, you would say "I got a car!". If you then replaced that, you would say "I got a new car!". So, if you met someone for the first time and the first thing they said to you was "I got a new car!", you would think "This is not the person's first car."

You wouldn't be *wrong* to say you got a new car if it was your first car, but most people would extrapolate that it was not your first car. 

Do people in the US not speak like this? Or did Reddit just apparently not like the rest of the comment? Because honestly, I am astounded it did as badly as it did.
