My cubicle neighbor

Every god damn morning:

*crunch crunch crunch* - chewing those nuts, mouth partially open. Then twirl your tongue around your teeth to get the bits out of your teeth. 

Ruffle the bag a little, get some good nuts. 

Switch to chips now..ruffle the bag, get some good chips...*crunnnnnnch crunch crunch crunch.*

Get the bits out of your teeth again.

*Titter tatter titter tatter* a little keyboard stroke. Mouse *click click*.

*Sssslurrp* some tea now. **Gulp** *ahhhhh, that's good tea*.

*Click click. Titter tatter titter tatter*

Scrape some yogurt now, get the last of the yogurt.

Now swallow and give me a calm, smug "good morning".

**FUCK YOU! FUCK YOUR YOGURT! FUCK YOUR TEA. GO FUCK YOUSELF!**
