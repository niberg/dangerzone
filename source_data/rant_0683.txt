I really hate Political ads.

It's not a matter of whether or not I agree with them or not. It's a matter of arguing pointless view/half-facts/stupid shit. 

I live in North Carolina, so right now I'm seeing alot of Tom Tillis and Kay Hagen attack ads. At this point i'd rather neither of them get any votes and we just leave the position open since they're all incompetents. 

"Kay hagen voted for Obama? Don't vote for her!" 

"Tom Tillis helped rich people!"

blah the fuck blah. No one is really saying anything about what *they* do. Just what this other person has/has not done. It's the same thing every day, and the worst part is that most of these are back to back. Watching tv and I see tom tillis hates teachers so I should vote for Kay, oh wait Kay hasn't passed a bill into law, vote for Tom now. 

Here's a novel idea: Tell me why I should keep you in work rather than why I shouldn't keep them. 

If I went to a job interview and went "Oh what are my skills? well let me tell you who doesn't have skills!" I'd be thrown out before the second question. Why the hell do we tolerate these complete morons to run our country? 

Anyway I'm not really that mad, i've just been meaning to vent this stupid crap and recently saw another ad so I figured I might aswell. So... how are you?
