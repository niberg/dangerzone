Kill me please

I feel bad writing this, but I'm having a lot of trouble these days. Today, for the first time I feel like if I had the means I would have done it. I feel trapped in a bad situation and just want out. I'm not particularly proud of feeling this way. Sorry for wasting your time, but it helps me fight back a bit to write this down.
