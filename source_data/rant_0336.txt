"If I'm cooking then somebody else is cleaning!"

Fair enough. But if no one cleans up and you still don't clean up, it is still your mess as much as anyone else's. If you know it needs to be done and you don't do it, you are wrong. Your responsibility for keeping a nice house does not end at asking people to clean up after you!
