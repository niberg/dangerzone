"Too low for what?"

So my parents have a car, pretty standard stuff. One day I'm in the passenger seat when a little beep beeps and a message comes up where the time, date, radio station is. This message gets me every time it comes up. "Fuel level too low." The intent of this message is sound. It informs the driver that the car needs a fill-up soon, which is normal! But too low for what?! "Fuel level TOO LOW." What does that mean?! It isn't too low for anything! Is it too low to run the car?! No! because the car is still fucking running! Is it too low for it to be an adequate level of fuel?! No! Because an adequate level of fuel is enough for the car to continue to drive, which that car is still able to do! If the message came up when the car was chugging to a halt that would be fine, because then it would actually be too low, and I would walk to get petrol with a smile on my face knowing the message actually made fucking sense. Fuck you Peugeot!
