Women...

Ah the power. A look could change everything. A bad day, a week, a life...

You've had power over me and you never knew it. Your look. Your random touch in homeroom. You have so many friends, more than I could ever count. How? Why were you so troubled like me but so popular nonetheless? Was it your charm? Your attractiveness? Your smile?

I bet it was your smile. 

We have homeroom every two weeks. The best morning I could ask for. Your smile is amazing. Your smile is intoxicating. 

Your smile is why I'm alive to write this. 

I love you KJS. Thank you for everything even if you don't know my name. Even if you have no idea who I am... 

Thank you.
