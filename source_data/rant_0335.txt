My incompetent film production partner

I decided to take film as an elective, because apparently applying to a CSU requires one year of an art production class. 

I've been in the class for ~3 months. The first stop motion film was incomplete, and now I am working on the second film (music video). The music video is going to shit just like the first film because of my partner. 

Issues with the first film:

* Partner lies about completing it.
* He invites others into the group without letting me know.
* With all these new people, he didn't know who had all the video resources.
* He has no phone, so we have to communicate via Steam. He is usually offline.
* When he wants to work, I'm told come over last minute. He can't seem to have a plan ahead. 
* Bitch about me not coming. What do you expect? I can't just stop by when you tell me last minute.
* Tries to hit on me, because he knows I'm gay (and he's bi) during work time.

Issues with the second film:

* Repeat just about everything from the first list.
* On the **first day**, he changes the song without my permission. After **we** agreed on one. 
* Got angry because I called him a liar, blocks all communication with me on Steam.
* Announces that he is leaving me to work with someone else.

Not only all of this, but what really pissed me off was that in the first film (where he lied about it being finalized), he gave me the excuse "I need help exporting it." I come all the way over to his house, when I arrive he tells me "I don't have the video files with me." Really? 

So, now I'm a soloist and have to do a cringey looking music video by myself. I'm self conscious as hell, and hate the idea of having myself on camera in front of everyone.

And, why does this matter to get into a CSU? What's the point of a moistly meaningless art class? My average ~3.8ish GPA goes down the damn drain because of this class.
