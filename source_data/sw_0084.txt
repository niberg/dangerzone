I could use some advice

A have a Facebook friend who doesn't really seem to be the type to struggle with depression.

Every time I've ever seen him he has a sunny disposition. He's always willing to lend a hand, a joke, or a smile. He's the type of guy that really seems unshakable, but tonight he posted a status that really seemed out of character for him. 

I copied this from his status: "With each passing day, I feel more and more like a failure. There's no other way to put it. I don't belong and the potential people see in me doesn't exist. Just stop believing in me and let me give up. I'm tired."

So far, his status has been liked multiple times, but no one has commented on it at all.

Should I consider this a warning sign? Do you think I should talk to him? What would be my best course of action in this situation?
