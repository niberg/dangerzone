I am at a loss and want to give up

So I'll try to make this brief and easy to read

* I'm 24 years male, and suffered for the last 8 years from a disease that I have no doubt will eventually kill me
* Was always shy, with low self esteem, but broke out of that shell sr year of HS
* Broke out of that shell and had more "friends" and girls than I knew what to do with
* It's now been 4 years since I have even kissed a girl and have made very few friends since. I get very attached to anyone who shows a caring side towards me, which leads to fights when my expectations aren't met, which led to many breakups.
* 3 years ago I became friends with a girl from work
* Over the last year or so I have gotten really close to her with her becoming my best and closest friend
* During the summer she did wonderful things for me when my disease was acting up (always checking up, going to doc appts with me, etc...)
* Trusting in her I told her how I was depressed. She told me she wanted to help me with that too, but I said no. She insisted.
* I then went to her when I was down and about
* Eventually she said she couldn't do it anymore as she isn't a therapist and I was taking up the very little free time she had. This made me mad.
* Then I started getting mad because my expectations weren't being met. "Why did you say this about x, but you have never said that about me?" etc...  This led to fights and more depression.
* Last Friday we fought about something (wasn't even me this time) and I guess it was the final straw because I snapped and said then don't be my friend. She then deleted me off all social media and wouldn't answer the phone a day before I just spent $500 to go on a weekend trip with her and others.
* I ended up seeing her in person that night through the help of the others that were going on that trip. At first it was pleasent and she said, look you need to focus on yourself, we will always be friends, I just need a break. But I fucked up and kept the conversation going and going to the point where she got annoyed and that we will always be friends turned into "I don't know what will happen between us" and from yes I will add you back on social media in time to "i have no idea"
* I ended up spending the night at her place because it was late and in the morning when I hugged her by I said, I hope this isn't the last time we talk and she said "you're being over dramatic, why does no one else get this?"



And we haven't talked since. I'm not sure what to do. We use to talk everyday. This was my best friend and really my only true friend. I know I'm not right in the head, but I still hurt. The thought that she may never talk to me again (the roommate says she believes she will, and is gonna hint at it this weekend for me) kills me. It makes it so hard to focus on the problems in my head. I feel like I have nothing now.
