I hate people who ask the most obvious fucking questions!!

I'm sitting up in my bed, forced to stay awake because one of my roommates asked such a stupid fucking question and I can't fall back asleep. 

It's currently 2:14 AM, and I'm supposed to get up in a couple of hours for a super early job I have to do for a relative. Just thirty minutes ago, my fucking dipshit of a roommate walked into my room, turned my bedroom light on, and shook me awake all while asking "Are you asleep?"

NO, YOU CUNT. I'M SNOWBOARDING IN MY ROOM WITH THE LIGHTS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, UNDER THE COVERS. 

Now I've got a headache and am gonna need to drink two cups of coffee today just so I dont murder anyone. Fuck.
