Stupid Sticker Club Chain Mail for kids.

I think it's fucking rude to try and rope friends and family into these stupid sticker club chain mail requests. I told my kid a couple weeks ago that her cousin had something sent in the mail to her. 

So basically the mom told me something was sent but didn't warn me ahead of time what it was. My kid is all excited to see what her cousin sent and all it is is a request to mail stickers to this kid and that kid plus mail this letter out to six other kids with your address on it so maybe you'll get stickers too and if you can't it's not fair blah-dee-fucking-blah-soccer-mom-guilt-trip-bullshit.

No, I'm not sending my address out to six other parents to do the same thing to them. This particular part of the chain ends with me. I am the weakest link. Goodbye.
