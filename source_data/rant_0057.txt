Hey Ubisoft, fuck you.

Seriously?  I had 30 minutes to just unplug and shoot some fucking pirates on an island and I end up spending that time troubleshooting your "ubisoft service thats not available at the moment"  only to try offline mode and have you tell me that I have to have signed in at least once in online mode? 

You guys suck.  I was on your side because I had no idea this kind of shit was going down.  I had no idea why everyone was all up in arms about how much you all suck ass.

fuck you 
fuck you
fuck you very much for wasting everyones time and gladly accepting my money for a game that I should be able to play whenever I damn well please.
