Snipping an asshole's headphones on transit.

From my commute on the skytrain/subway home from downtown, I came across a hooded man who looked like he was in his mid 20s. While his headphones were on, he repeatedly blurted out segments of the rap songs he was loudly listening to very frequently. As this wouldn't bother me normally that much, there were alot of kids on the train as there is obviously a ton of profanity in the songs he was "rapping" to. After a while, there was an awkward atmosphere of parents contemplating to ask him to stop. What really did it for me was when anyone tried to tell him to cut it out, he asked them to read between the lines, which is essentially flipping them off. 

I fucking had it at this point. I said to myself that if he gets off at my stop, I will stealthily pull out my swiss army scissors hid in my sleve and cut that asshole's headphone cable. Sure enough, himself including alot of other commuters lined up for the next stop. I go behind him and swiftly snip that shit after the doors open. Right after I did the deed, I walked the opposite direction from him and just heard a loud scream  after a few seconds "COCKSUCKER". 

**TL;DR**: Man wearing headphones on skytrain loudly and annoyingly rapping profanities while essentially flipping people off if they asked him to stop. I took the matter in my own hands with some small scissors and this asshole's headphone cable.
