I have a lot of pills, a lot of severe depression and self-loathing and I think tonight might be the night.

hi. i've taken about 9 Zopiclone in the past hours, each tablet is about 7.5 mg each. IN total that's about 67.5mg. I really do want to commit suicide and I'm miserable every fucking day, for the past 5 years. The only thing stopping me from really pushing ahead with the plan is the grief it would cause my parents, my mother specifically. fuck guys. 
i have a pretty great life, a lot of friends, a job, money, the perfect girl but nothing beats this depression when it comes roaring back harder than ever. It rears its ugly fucking head and I'm down back in the dark deep hole that seems to cave in on you. I'm tired of being a miserable sack of shit every day, having to fake a smile. Everything hurts all the time. It's all for no discernible reason either. I have everything I want but I'm still a miserable, severely depressed cunt and I think I might just do it.
