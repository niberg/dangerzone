I had a "good dream" about suicide

I just woke up from a nap. In my dream I was in a book. The book had a narrator and it was narrated like a horribly inappropriate children's book. I don't live with my family IRL but I did in the the book.

"Hiss hiss" goes the daddy
"Bite bite" goes the sister
The book ended with me waking up about ten minutes before the rest of the family. I realize that there is a way out of it, and I shoot myself. And the book made it sound like this was a happy ending. I don't know if I was happy in the dream or not but I woke up very disturbed. I wonder if suicide will look like a "happy ending" in the future.
