She comes back like nothing happened.

I have a close friend who, for 3 days, didn't want to talk to me, and I don't know why. when I ask her about what happened to her that day, she is like "I don't want to talk about it" or "I don't want to share anything to you" or she doesn't reply. then suddenly today, she messaged me, like nothing nothing happened, like she suddenly became jolly when talking to me, too jolly it's irritating. then she was like "did you get angry at me?". In my mind was "WOW really, wtf. you didn't know you ignored me these past few days? I thought you're a close friend of mine?". I mean really who does this to their close friends?? someone's treating you like a bestfriend and all you do is that? wow, just wow.
