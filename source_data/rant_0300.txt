Gaming rant: Permadeath / Full Loot

Unpopular opinion time, but I just found this subreddit so I want to submit a rant. I am so sick of every game that has particular features that I like being non-optional permadeath / full loot / whatever. The Long Dark? Open world wilderness survival game in a cold climate with other hostile and non-hostile survivors to be added later? Oh that sounds cool, oh wait it's non-optional permadeath. DayZ? An open world zombie survival game that includes things like fishing and vehicles? Full loot. An MMORPG that is outside of the norm and actually sounds fun? Full loot (Life is Feudal, Mortal Online, Gloria Victis has something similar too). Like seriously can I get some fun games that have this as an OPTION instead of saying "Well, this is how we enjoy the game so we're going to make it the only way you can play the game." Tired of this shit.
