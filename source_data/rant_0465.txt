IM SO SORRY I CANT FUCKING BE YOUR CHEW TOY.

I really care about this friend. I do. I've known her for a year and a half and she's a caring, close friend of mine. She's clearly a victim of social anxiety, she's negative and a bit whiney. I don't mind that much cause there's a lot of bullshit in modern culture. But this girl whines about the most ridiculous shit. Oh, I can't talk to you cause I need to study? I'm so fucking sorry. I guess I'm not your friend. I need to go to sleep? I'm so sorry I'm apparently not your friend. No, I don't have feelings for you. I don't like you as more than a friend. I'm so fucking sorry, stop complaining about it and copping an attitude when I talk to a girl. Seriously, oh no, i am dating a girl who I share lots of interests and beliefs with, we have chemistry, oh fucking no! It's not you?? I'm so sorry! Let's just stop and fit your needs! 

You're depressed? I'm sorry. So am I! I have manic depression and bipolar disorder! I'm so fucking sorry you think you need to kill yourself. I've told you a thousand and three times that I care about you and want to give you wise advice if you're willing to take it. I've offered to pay for a damn counselor for you, and you're telling me *i don't fucking care?* No! Enough. I need this to end. 

I care about you. But this is ridiculous. I can't deal with this abuse and whining anymore. I'm here for you, but I'm done catering to you.
