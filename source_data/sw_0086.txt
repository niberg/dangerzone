This just saved my life.

I was in the worst of the worst. For those who know it comes and goes.. I was literally rocking back and fourth crying listening to music. I clicked on a random link in r/pics.. This is the album and the song that made me cry even harder. This time the tears came for what I wanted to be, not what I wanted to do to myself.

I only hope its as effective next time.
