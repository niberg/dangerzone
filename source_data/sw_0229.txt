Made the decision to kill myself slowly. Fuck this shit, I'm out!

I've always been so straight laced.  Surrounded by drugs and all other bs, I never did anything like that.  I saw how it ripped apart lives.  I saw how it killed the people closest to me.

Well, a lot of shit has happened.  Today was the last fucking straw.  I always thought I'd go the traditional route of suicide, but I have made the decision to go out slowly.  Live fast die young, all that shit.  


Went out and bought a bunch of drugs.  Gonna start drinking.  Gonna kill myself slowly.  At least it will be fun this way and numb out all the shit I can't unsee.  Just putting this message here, almost as a mark, the last day as my old self.  Bye world and fuck you!  You're one cruel sonofabitch
