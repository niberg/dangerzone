I don't know how I feel anymore. (15M)

I'm not trying anything yet, but every night brings heavy contemplation.

Home life: My parents are alcoholics. They hate each other. They ignore me unless it's to belittle me. They use all their money on alcohol (so much so that we haven't had heat in three weeks). I stay in my room with my computer most of the time.

School life: The only group of friends I've had (and I've had them for ten years) are older than me by a year and a half. They've all got cars and are constantly doing things together, without me. They won't pick me up because even if I did have money to do anything, I live in the middle of nowhere.

I talked to guidance in school, they called my parents and now my parents make fun of me because I had/have suicidal thoughts.

I'm failing classes because I have no motivation to do anything, and any time I do homework I think of being alone, in a building with eight hundred people in it. It makes me really anxious.

When I get anxious, I can hear people flat out screaming at me.

I'm a chronic insomniac, and sleep maybe three hours a night (I'm laying down trying to sleep for nine hours). Whenever I do manage to sleep, I wake up from nightmares about 45 minutes later. Nightmares include: me being killed by myself or others, me watching my life drag by with no social interaction, and me being rich, only to lose everything for various reasons.

I have a knee that needed surgery four years ago, but that never happened. It hurts to walk anywhere.

I have a crush whom I constantly think about, as if I'm trying to convince myself she tolerates me, let alone likes me back.

I have no plans for the future, be it the next day or next decade.

As I write this, more thoughts run through my head. The metaphorical "only way out" seems to become less figurative by the day.
