Almost completed my checklist, ready to go

I have been working on a list of things that need to be accomplished before I leave.  Not a bucket list of fun stuff, pay off bills, get house in order, make sure I've hit a point at work where it won't cause a huge disruption.  This morning was about letting someone know the plan...

I called a hotline so there was some trail for people to follow.  To understand that I've been trying to get help, but it hasn't been working.  Someone will look at my call list and recognize I didn't just wake up in the morning and do something rash, simply because one night had been bad.  All of the nights have been bad.  The mounting guilt over things, some not even in my control or that I had a choice in, is overwhelming.  Sleeping 2 hours and having a strange sense of calm has made it clear I'm ready to go.  It's like the peace they talk about others experiencing before they die.  

There are times when my heart races, but that's the continued anxiety making its headway.  I eat, but only get sick later.

Over the weekend I tried to do something nice for someone.  Just a small gesture of friendship, the result was my being treated like a ghost.  Not even a simple Thank you, nothing.  I could have just as easily been anyone delivering a package.  All I said was Feel Better, not complicated.  Common courtesy usually gets you a thank you.

It's just another in a long line of people who aren't there.  When you hit the point where you are reaching out and others don't care enough to tell you they don't have time, what's left?  So I've picked up a selection of medications and plan to take advantage of them over the weekend.  I'm only waiting so I can finish things, so that whomever is cleaning up the wreckage has little to do.  Insurance is covered, funeral is covered, bills are prepaid and I'll pay off the credit card that morning.  

I'm done.  Just wanted someone to know!

Update 1 - today's tasks are complete.  Spent time making sure to get help for someone else who I know isn't getting the right type of help.  Growing more at peace with all of this.

Tuesday 11/11 - Last night I made sure to gather all of my papers into one place and divide them up.  Tonight will be about making sure I haven't missed something.  This strange sense of calm, a determined path has replaced some of the pain.  I can't help but think my absence is the only thing that makes sense.  

I have to finish things up at work.  Wrap it up as it were.  Soon it will be over, I'm sorry I can't be stronger.  That left me some time ago.
