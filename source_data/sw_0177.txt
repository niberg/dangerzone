Contentment Achieved

So I have struggled with depression for a long time. Really for as long as I can remember. I always felt lonely too, and I thought that if I could just stop feeling lonely, I wouldn't feel so depressed all the time. Well, as it happens, I eventually (within the last year) have found a group of amazing people to associate with, and I no longer feel lonely all the time. For a while, I felt really happy with life. I was finally part of a community with people who cared about me and I cared about, and that was awesome. But for a good amount of time now, I have realized that I am actually very content with my life in every way. I want nothing more from myself. I have worked hard and excelled in the things I love the most, and I have become someone to a group of great people. Oddly enough, I really just want to kill myself now. I am perfectly content, and I don't want to live anymore. I don't know if that makes any sense to any of you, but I just feel so ready to die. I don't have any more desires. I am not lonely or sad or regretful. I just want to die. I just want that peace.
