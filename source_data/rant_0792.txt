Nosleep and the stories

Alright, I don't mind that we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for these stories (even though some are just ridiculous).

What does annoy me though is that every damn story is part of a series, even if you couldn't realistically spread these events through multiple posts. Plus, I don't know about anyone else, but why is every other story about kids? Kids aren't that scary to be honest, and not everyone can relate to "My daughter was kidnapped by a witch" or whatever crap they're peddling. It just infuriates me, and has meant that I can't read nosleep anymore
