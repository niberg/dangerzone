Fuck standby lights.

Why the fuck does everything these days have fucking standby lights, and why the FUCK ARE THE ALWAYS FUSION POWERED, BRIGHTER THAN THE ACCRETION DISK OF A QUASAR, EYE MELTINGLY PUTRID BLEU? Do I really need to know if I can turn something on? Is it that necessary for morons to know that their monitor can turn on? Speaking of monitors, why is it that my monitors standby light is not only Brighter-Than-The-Fucking-Sun-Bleuâ„¢, why THE FUCK DOES IT BLINK EVERY FUCKING MICROSECOND (1/2 of a second)? I have to put my entire stack of 3 pillows on my face just to block out half of the light created by it, and you know what? While I'm at it, why the fuck do microwaves beep when you hit the buttons, or when it's done? Is it really that hard to remember; "Oh hey, I put my soup in the microwave one minute ago, better go get the bloody thing"?

TL;DR: Fuck those bleu blinking shits called standby lights.
