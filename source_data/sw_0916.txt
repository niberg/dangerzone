Crippled and hurting

Tonight I had to call my caregiver in twice because was hurting really badly and needed to be turned over... I'm starting to develop a pressure sore from laying in one spot too long and I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me... I've already attempted suicide in July... I'm seeing someone to help my depression and feelings of burden.. But sometimes (like tonight) I feel like it would be better for everyone if I was dead... I keep wishing for it... I can't sleep... I can't stop crying... I hate feeling this way...
