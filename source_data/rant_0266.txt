A kick you when your down day

I work my butt off all day and night. I work and go to school full time and like to think of myself as a good student. I study harder then anyone I know but I don't have anything to show for it. Today started with a 76 which wasn't bad but I studied for weeks for this exam and for what? A mediocre test score that brought my average down 4 points. Next class I got my chemistry quiz back. Fucking 48. I didn't even pass. I studied so hard and really gave it my all and I couldn't even pass. At least I can defend a 76 but this is crazy bad and my average dropped 8 points for it. Next was calculus which was an 84. In all my studying and hard work I can't even get a 90. Kids next to me are smiling and asking how I did in hopes that I'll ask back so they can show off their great score that they're so proud of and meanwhile I work 10 times harder yet somehow have worse scores. Meanwhile I work for 4 hours a day on weekdays and 10 a day Saturday and Sunday for a shitty apartment and roommate while they have parents paying all their bills. Not to mention I lost 50 bucks this week. Sometimes I think I should just drop out of school and take another job. I'd still work but I could get a better apartment plus I might be able to actually get some sleep once in a while and not have to deal with so much failure.
