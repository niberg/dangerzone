Everything is so fucked up.

What a great time to be alive. 

Yeah, right.

Today is a terrible time to be alive, especially if you're young and trying to make your way in the world. The rich keep getting richer. The poor keep getting poorer. Politicians don't give a fuck about the people they are supposed to benefit and protect. Government agencies are created to spy on it's citizens and keep track of everything they do, putting on a facade of safety, held in place by secrets and lies. The government is just a puppet of the bloated corporations, manipulating laws in their favor. These same corporations continually rape their customers because they can, without giving a fuck because they know they can't fail. Jobs keep getting fewer, and smaller stores and chains are swallowed by larger companies. Jobs become more and more competitive. You need a degree or your resume goes immediately in the trash. You better have had at least a 3.5 GPA or in the trash. You better have had experience or in the trash. You get hardly any benefits. Things such as decent healthcare are being thrown out. Things such as pensions are being thrown out. 401Ks are being diminished or even gotten rid of entirely. Everything has a price now, and that price keeps getting higher and higher. Our lives are ruled by pieces of green rag-paper. Loyalty means nothing. Honesty means nothing. Trust means nothing. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living, if I should even bother continuing to exist when everything seems so absolutely bleak and hopeless. No one wants to hear my voice, listen to my opinions. I am nothing and so are millions of others in this disparate time.

Edit: Apparently a little hyperbole is enough to get wrecked by a bunch of people and a person's opinions are invalid if they live in a first world country with a part-time job. Life can only be bad if you are a starving child in Africa. Also this is apparently the most stereotypical post ever made.
