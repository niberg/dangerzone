"When you talk like you're smart, you sound like a rude snob. Talk normal!": An Educated Rant

Yes, I speak well. I am in the process of obtaining my undergraduate degree in English and I'm actively planning my Master's degree plan. I HATE IT when people think it's "cool" to speak like you're ignorant and to basically talk shit to anyone who "talks like a snob". I am not a snob. I am educated. I've worked my ass off getting an education!


**I was a single teenage mom.**

**I was forced to drop out of high school my junior year.**

**I had to take remedial classes at my local community college until my grades were high enough to get into college.** 

**I have sacrificed my time/youth/sleep in order to get the education I didn't get for free like everyone else.**

I am now 24 years old now and have been in college since I was 18. Even now, I am taking a small break from my American Modernism homework to type this up. 


When I speak to someone like I would speak to a professor or a classmate, I'm not trying to speak like I'm "above" them, I see it as respect. Respect that I do not think you're so ignorant that I have to talk to you like I talk to my 1st grader. I see you are an intelligent human being that I can use my "5 dollar words" with. Telling me that I sound like a rude bitch is just ignorant. Especially when FAMILY says this. I understand that I say words that aren't commonly spoken, but hey guess what, they learned something today!

But honestly, if my 7 year old knows words like "condemned" and "disintegrate", maybe I should talk to them like they are in 1st grade.


This wouldn't bother me as much if some stranger said this, but the fact that family is bothered by the way I speak makes me very sad. I am the only female to go to college and rather than being proud of all of the trials and tribulations I've overcome, I'm looked at as a snob because, and I quote, "[I'm] educated, and now [I] think I'm some kind of hot shit..." So I'll go back to not speaking to anyone when in family gatherings and being seen as Reallyterriblename, who thinks she's too good to speak to anyone.

There is no winning.
