My English teacher has no clue as to what communism is.

So, we started reading a The Crucible, an allegory for McCarthyism using the Salem witch trials. He says "I don't want to influence your political beliefs, but..." And then he goes into a rant.

He says communism means no free elections. In a real communist society, there would be no elections because there would be no positions of power to be elected to. He confuses it with Stalinism and the USSR, and uses North Korea and China as examples of why communism is bad. Firstly, both were founded by complete nutjobs, and North Korea never even came close to communism, moreso fascism if anything. China was also never communist. None of these are communist, at least as how Marx said it. 

Countries like Canada, Finland, and Germany are more socialist than any of the self-declared communist states. My teacher even has a copy of the Communist Manifesto on the bookshelf. Why, then, does he not understand any of it?!
