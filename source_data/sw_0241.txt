I need some advice

First of all, this isn't about me, it's about my older sister.

She has anxiety and depression, and has been constantly going to therapy and taking meds since she was 12.

One of the main things that constantly triggers her is my father. While he obviously loves her and cares for her, he has anger problems and causes her a lot of distress. They have talked about things and they try to understand each other, but she just keeps getting set off. Recently, she's talked more and more about suicide and been saying some suicidal things.

Basically, I want to know how I can help her. I try to be there for her, but sometimes it feels that I can't do anything. I'm afraid that I won't be able to do anything to stop her if those thoughts get to her.
