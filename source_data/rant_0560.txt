Why is the youtube community so fucking terrible?

Seriously the youtube comments need to be removed entirely. Look at [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oe9nulHVOg) video's comments. There is one guy calling the lady out for being a scumbag and the rest of them are defending the woman or just being flagrantly racist and calling the guy a "nigger." There are also some comments saying stuff like, "Why is it bad that she can call this guy a nigger but blacks say it to each other all the time?" You fuckin idiot; it's the same reason you can make fun of your sibling but no one else can. The only thing worse than a racist is a diet racist. At least most real racists *know* they're assholes. This "white rights" crowd see nothing wrong with calling blacks niggers yet get their panties in a bunch when anyone says "cracker" or does anything mildly racist to whites.

I used to be against Youtube forcing people to use their real names but after years of witnessing this bullshit I would gladly support IP tracking to unmask these cowards. Fucking pathetic that in 2014 we still have people that think like this.
