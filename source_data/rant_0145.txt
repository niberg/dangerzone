If you're going to have children, keep a leash on them!

Okay, I don't mean literally leash them, but man did I think it was necessary today!

Normally I have no problem with children or their parents. I think children are great, but I've always told myself that I don't want to have kids. They just weren't to me. I have the fear of not being able to care for them on my own, and I come from a single parent household and I never want my kids to go through what I have. But I digress.

So my mother and I decided to get together and buy some of the frozen items we'll need to keep for Thanksgiving (While it's still cheap). So we're walking down the side of the frozen isle when a little boy, 3 or 4 years old runs up to us and sudden shoves over our cart.

Are you kidding me? I know that in the series of things that stupid little kids do, this isn't bad at all, but my goodness.

I've had worse happen to me with little kids. But it makes me so angry that people don't parent their kids. If I had ever done something like that, I would have gotten the, "Do you want to take a trip to the bathroom?" threat, which trust me you do NOT want to go on that trip.

Future parents of Reddit; I beg you, please teach your children to behave in public. It's not cute when your kids yells and screams. It's not nice when they throw tantrums and hit other adults. It's not funny when we, the rest of the public, have to deal with your unholy children.
