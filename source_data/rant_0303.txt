I'm fucking tired of "le reddit army has arrived" in the comments of every YouTube video I found on the front page.

These idiots not only make reddit look bad, they're fucking annoying. Then that stupid troll account "Berta Lovejoy." It's like circlejerk and justneckbeardthings have to have a fucking field day and troll away.
