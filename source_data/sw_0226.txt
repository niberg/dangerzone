just sick of everything

Guess I need some background info. Im a 15 yr old transgender girl from the middle of fucking nowhere ontario. Currently out to my parents, but my father despises me for it. I'm sick of this fucking shit. Every day I hear prejudice and hatred tossed around, which shoves me back into the closet i may never have come out of, for fear of my life. Im sick of living a lie, sick of living like this, I wish I wasn't trans. I'm feeling really low tonight, and I'm realizing nobody will care, or notice I'm gone.
