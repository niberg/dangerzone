Who's the dick - roommate or myself?

Forgive wall of text on mobile etc etc

  So my roommate had friends in from out of town. They're loud he's loud. My SO works nights. He comes home at four am and I almost get mad at him cause of slight noise to not interrupt roommates guest on the couch. 


at about 7:30 am (on Sunday/this am) my roommate and his friends wake up and start making tons of noise. I get up and stupidly justify when he apologizes for waking us up.

Then I get mad...I hear one of the guests say something about smoking and my roommate says "I don't smoke but he clearly needs it" and I know he smokes so my only conclusion was he was making a dick comment about my weed smoking since there was a partial joint on my desk. Wtf? 

And I still can't get back to my bed...so much for apologizing cause it's only gotten louder. My sweet boyfriend is still trying to sleep but at least he has some earplugs. Blah. 


Update: Jackass decided to leave a (just met last night) bar stranger in the living room for 3 hours cause "he didn't wanna see the same movie my friend and I were seeing" who also knocked on my door and wanted to hang out with my SO and I...we were in bed.
