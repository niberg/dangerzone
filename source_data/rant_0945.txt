I'm so angry i could get pissed and punch a fucking bouncer

I've just about fucking had enough. My phone broke on Friday and my carrier said they'd fix it if i took it into store. I arranged my only fucking day off around going into town and it turns out the bloke in the call centre had fucking lied to me and I have to send it to apple, costing me Â£70. Get home to a frantic Facebook message from my brother saying he's been trying to phone me all day to tell me my Ma has been taken into hospital with a twatting brain haemorrhage. Rushed home via a ridiculously expensive train that was delayed 40 minutes because the shitty train in from had broken down and found out that my Dad was in hospital too because he'd been attacked by wasps. Got back to uni late night on Sunday to find my housemates had used all my shitting butter so I had dry toast as my main meal and ended up ordering a takeaway sending weeks of gym work down the shitter. After two days of burying my head in the sand I wanted to chill and smoke some weed to get my head straight. The cock sucking dealer never showed up and I've just about had enough of it all. Sometimes I wish I believed in God... Then I'd have somebody to blame
