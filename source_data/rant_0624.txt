People who think it's ok to smoke those e cigarettes, that happen to smell like shit, on a public bus need to get the fuck off.

Seriously. You may think you're all bad ass because "it isn't real smoke!!" but it still has a smell and it is a disgusting smell and you need to fucking stop. I don't care if it's outside or whatever. But an indoor area like restaurants and public buses are not the place to be smoking them. Also there is a sign clearly stating that smoking of any kind on the bus is prohibited, you only got away with it because the bus driver wasn't paying attention. You aren't cool. You aren't trying to prove a point. You're only being an asshole to about 30 other people on the bus.
