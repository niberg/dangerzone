Female teacher fucks a male student

Saw on Facebook and here on Reddit today about a 24 year old female teacher that slept with a 16 year male student. All the comments I've seen are about how lucky that boy is. Apparently, the student's ex girlfriend was the one who went to the police about it. Comments on Facebook about her? She's apparently a jealous cunt! Not my words. Sicking. I can't believe people are actually calling an underage girl a horrible name like that, when she did the right thing!

If it was a 24 year old male teacher sleeping with a 16 year old female student, it would be different. Everyone would be calling the male teacher a rapist, and how sorry they felt about the girl. There would be no comments about how lucky the student was, or how they wanted it. 

We've all been in High School. As a dude, there were one or two female teachers I thought were super hot, and everyone has had the fantasy of nailing their teacher. However. That is illegal. That isn't just a guy thing either. I had girls talk about how hot some teacher was when I was back in High School, and what they'd let the male teacher do to them.

I hate the double standard bullshit.
