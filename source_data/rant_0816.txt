My employer released a video about open enrollment instead of just telling us when it is

My company announced it's open enrollment dates for the next benefit year. They sent an email to the entire company about it. But the email contained no actual information. It was a link to a video.

I click the video and it's just a fancy graphics presentation. The first minute of the video is just stupid moving graphics telling us what open enrollment is all about. But not in useful terms, in incredibly generic terms ("it's about your life and your future"). Only in the last 10 seconds of the video does it finally give you the dates for open enrollment (which is the most important thing for anyone).

WTF? Just put the dates in the email instead of making us watch an entire video just to find out when we can make changes.

People are way overdoing video and media these days when text is so much easier to process. I read this one "tip" on introducing people to each other. Instead of just sending an email to your friend, introducing them to a potential business prospect, you make a recording. Most people have smart phones, so you can just make a recording telling your friend all the information they need about the business prospect. Then you email the recording to your friend. 

Hmmm, an audio recording using your phone . . . why not just call your friend? Or why not type a quick paragraph or two? It's probably quicker to type two paragraphs than it is to make a recording and send it to your friend. It's certainly easier to read two paragraphs than it is to listen to a recording. And the friend won't be wondering why you didn't just call him instead of doing a weird roundabout of making a recording an emailing him.
