28, depression, agoraphobic and psychosis for 12 years, tried everything seen loads of doctors.

Not really looking for help as such. Just thought I'd post here to vent a bit. Wednesday I was prescribed a month worth of diazempam which do help a lot but I got drunk and took them all. It did nothing but put me to sleep for a day leaving me with no memory.

Had enough of life. I'm unemployed I have one friend which I don't know if I can trust or not. My family don't give a damn about getting me help or trying themselves to help out even in little ways.

So this is the night. I shall hang myself in the local woods. I always loved the trees in this park and I've always felt so connected to it and so that's where I want to end my life. Sorry for being a pussy...Never posted here before.  

Thank you to all on Reddit for keeping me entertained, happy-ish, sad and making life semi bearable for the years I've been here.

Take care everyone.
