I tried guys, I promise I did. But there's nothing left to try.

I just can't do it anymore. I'm procrastinating everything, I can't find the motivation to be productive. I tried counseling but it doesn't seem to help when my counselor doesn't cancel (which is rare). I work out every other day and although everyone says it does wonders for depression it's not helping me. Maybe I'm not working out hard enough but I definitely feel like I'm kicking my ass afterwards. Oh and my whole life I've been told college is this wonderful place where you have little responsibility and can "figure yourself out" but I have no idea who or what the Fuck I am. Oh and a girl lied to me to sleep with me and then tossed me aside so overall I'm just not doing well. I feel like I've done more than enough to say I tried but I just can't do it anymore. I'm just fucking tired guys. I'm sorry.
