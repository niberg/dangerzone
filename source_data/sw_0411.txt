the past week or so

starting around last week Thursday. (so before Halloween) I started feeling depressed. I have been suffering from depression for 8 years now. yet, this is a new kind of depression I had never felt. I became detached. I started becoming so frustrated I wanted to tear my skin off. I started cutting again. On Monday (so the 2nd?) my best friend attempted suicide at school. Blood was everywhere. Ambulance was called. All I can think about is how she had the guts to do it, and I'm just holding on by a single thread... I'm wondering why I can't stand to live. My friends are saying they love me, need me. Yet, I feel as if they don't. I'm slowly detaching myself from society. I'm afraid once I completely detach I'll do it. I'm afraid is what I'm trying to say. Afraid, but I feel the darkness engulfing me. I'm not sure what to do. not sure what else to say. so I'll sum it up. I want to die, everyday I live I feel sick (legitimately nauseous), and I'm afraid of what will happen after. I don't know what to do.
