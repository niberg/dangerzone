Help, the next 24 hours will decide my fate

After 5 years of depression I have finally given up. There will be no 2015 for me, I can't believe I lasted this long. Soon I hope that I will be nothing but memory. Is it too late for me? Am going to bed in the hope that tomorrow is a better day. But I doubt it will be. Someone out there please, I don't know what to do in this empty shell anymore...... I am losing my fight
