My mom's an idiot.

I just noticed my septic tank needed to be emptied because water will not go down any drains. I know its the septic because it needs to be emptied every year at this time (Smaller tank). I noticed this while in the shower and proceeded to tell my mom not to run water as it will not drain. "Ok" she says. So I run down to grab my clothes only to come back up to see my mom giving my little sister a shower. "I JUST TOLD YOU NOT TO RUN WATER"  "She needs a shower though"  like wtf....did I just say....not only that but she knew I was getting ready and hopped into the bathroom first chance she had. 
She always does shit like that. "Oh you're going out with your friends, how bout you go way the fuck out of your way to the grocery store to pick up this one thing that I only kind of need and probably wont use for a week anyways"...Every fucking time.
