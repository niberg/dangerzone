I'm done. Someone help me please?

I'm starting to plan my exit from this world. I hate to admit that, but it's true. It's not that I want to do it 100%, it's just that death seems so much better than living in this hell for any longer. I don't see any reason to live. At all. I'm lonely, pathetic, can't eat, can't sleep, bored of everything, not motivated to do anything, and I hate myself. No one would care if I was to go. 

Can anyone here maybe give me some reason to keep going? Because I certainly can't find one myself.  Please, I'm asking you guys one last time as a last resort. Help me before it's too late. You're all amazing people.
