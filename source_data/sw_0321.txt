This may not be the right place to say this but...

I just wanted to say thank you. I came onto this sub about 2 months ago. I just wanted to talk to anyone. My girlfriend had left me and I felt like I was letting every single person on this planet that cared about me down. The past 2 months have been some of the hardest of my life, but with the help of talking to people on here and my family I feel like things are starting to get better. You guys helped me to be optimistic when I didn't even think it was possible. So again thank you all. And for anyone thats having suicidal thoughts and you're reading this just try to talk to someone. It makes a hell of a difference to know someone will listen and care about you. And things do get worse before they get better. You just have to think about those that do care. No matter how many there are. Anyways I'm sorry for ranting. Just wanted to get it off my chest.
