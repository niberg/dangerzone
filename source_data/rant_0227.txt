Nobody is "doing it just for attention."

If there's one thing that bothers me about Reddit, it's the fact that lots of people have some sort of need to look down on anybody that isn't them. I always see these AskReddit threads that are titled "What is your unpopular (read: popular) opinion?" and there's always one comment that gets to me. To paraphrase:

"If you're under [age] and claim to be gay/bisexual, I will assume that you're doing it for attention."

People like this have become exactly why I'm afraid to come out. I, like the people they're describing, am a young person who is part of the LGBT community, and I'm pretty sure no one would do that. People have come to associate teenaged gay/bisexual people with their bullshit stereotype of "lel so random hot topic invader zim holds up spork" that I have never seen in real life.

I want myself and everybody else to be able to be who they are. The most puzzling thing about this is that I thought the general consensus on here was that homophobia was bad- did I not read the fine print of it being only if you're male and aged 21 or above? What makes it okay for people to be judgmental of others based on the most trivial things?

Just needed to get this off my chest.
