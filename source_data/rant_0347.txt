Halloween- Its A social contract

If your kid is old enough to go trick or treating without supervision, they are too old to be trick or treating.
If they are with you, you need to control them. Don't let them knock on doors for 5 minutes if there are no decorations and the lights are out. In apartment complexes the lights are on automatically for safety. If there is no pumpkin or sign don't let them knock.
Also I don't give a fuck if you have to cut holes in a sheet, make a mask out of construction paper/printer paper, make some sort of fucking costume. The amount of kids I saw tonight that were trick or treating without costumes, but were with their parents disgusted me.
I understand times are tight (Although I do live in a fairly well to do area) but do something. If you can't front the 20 bucks for some sort of costume, MAKE SOMETHING together. It's a great bonding experience and they'll remember that shit for the rest of their lives.
"Remember that time we made a Frankenstein's Monster mask with some string and paper for Halloween? That was one of my favorite years, even though I was embarrassed to wear it."
Also, if your 14 year old kid knocks on my door asking for candy (Especially with no costume) I'm not giving him or her any unless they are walking around with their little brother. I'll play along then because they are doing something cool for their sibling (Even though they were probably strong armed into it).
Lastly, make your kids say Trick Or Treat. If I open the door and they stare at me with vacant stares, I'm shutting the door and going back to my movie.
This is the social contract alright people? Put your kid in a costume, go with them (or send another responsible person to go) make them say trick or treat, I give them candy.
You don't hold up your end, I'll stand there and eat candy before I go back inside. Doesn't matter to me.
