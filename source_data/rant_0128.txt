It fucking pisses me off when the cashiers at Walmart only put one thing in a bag. A t-shirt doesn't need a bag all to itself.

For instance today they TRIPLE bagged each bottle of wine separately, gave my t-shirt its own bag and only put 2-3 things in each of the other bags. I really need to start using my reusable bags, but I always forget them.
