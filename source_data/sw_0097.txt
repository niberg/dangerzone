I don't want to die.

I really don't want to die. But I have severe PTSD from things in my past and I just closet them in. I have not been happy in probably about 4 or 5 years now. It fucking sucks that I cant be happy ever. If only I could have a brief sense of relieve. Please help because I feel like im just going to crack one day and end it.
