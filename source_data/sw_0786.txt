I don't see my life getting any better, and I have no option but to end it.

I'm 23 years old. The days keep passing and my life isn't changing. I've tried to be a more positive person, be healthier, and focus on my school work but all of the things I've learned as a child fucked me over. Thanks to having careless parents, I've turned into a lazy person without any work ethic, or care for her body. I don't know anything. I am an idiot. I am graduating college in December and have no idea what the fuck to do, and of course no one will hire me because what skills do I possess? I have a boyfriend who is extremely distant. I try to connect with him, but most of the time I'm taking my anger out on him. I have a lot of anger because I haven't accomplished anything. I am so depressed to the point where I can't get out of bed, cant' shower or eat healthy. All I do is complain. What the fuck is the point anymore? I don't know how I can bring myself out of this mess and I've tried and tried before. There is this overwhelming sadness that  fills me up, and I transfer it to every person I come into contact with. I'm addicted to negativity, and I JUST NEED SOME HELP. SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, I'M CRYING OUT FOR HELP BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY ANYMORE.
