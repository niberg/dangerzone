All the uplifting mantras don't work anymore. I really want to die. Now what?

I used to take solace in the fact that things will likely get better and that I won't ever be like this again. I don't really care anymore. I don't care if it gets better. I don't even care if future me would be chilled by what strong feelings I have now. I don't care about my lost potential. I don't care about how great it is that I was born in a first world country without any major issues from birth. The people who would be deeply hurt by me never existing again? I don't really care about them anymore. I want to be selfish. I guess my organs could be used for something.

I don't want to go through the soul crushing motions of the mental health system. I don't want to tread harder just to have a slight chance of things getting better sooner. I don't want to be examined or have some professional pretend to care about me individually. 

I just don't want to hurt anymore and I don't have the energy to fix it the "right" way. I'd rather give that all up instead of dealing with life for a few moments longer.

I have no drive to do anything. It hurts to wake up. It hurts to try at anything. It hurts to think. Everything I do is either painful or useless and distracting me from the pain. I only feel content when I'm drifting off in bed. My mind is blank, yet I'm still thinking about surreal nonsense. I assume that's what dying is like.

I don't fully want to commit. I want to see if there's anything else out there that could change my mind. I've thought for a while, and can't come up with anything. Any ideas?

I don't feel up for writing out my problems here, but I can answer if you ask. 

I don't know if I'm mentally ill or just have some really shitty circumstance.
