Society says I should

I've never liked society since my earliest memories. Was always interested in math and science, things of absolutes. At age 12 I started cutting myself, drinking, abusing medication, stealing, vandalism. By 14 breaking and entering, theft that continues on. At 16 I was in a mental ward for bipolar during 9/11 and when the news broke I thought good, maybe they can hit my city as I stared out the window looking at a major inner city building. At 17 arrested again from others snitching on me as had been since I was 12 I entered a drug court program. I completed with a girlfriend of mine dishonestly becoming pregnant. I held up my responsibility and provided a house, vehicles, medical insurance and safety for us all. I was finally coming through to your lives. She cheated on me within 4 months of my childs birth. I attempted to fight the man 10 years my age but he wouldn't confront me. Before hand I'd meet him, bought a car from him and befriended him. In a rage after finding out what was going on. After being hit by my childs mother for demanding to know where he was, I flipped, blacked out and raped her. Sometime after I went back to my old ways and committed more crimes giving up hope. I have lost my child for ten years and see myself as society see's me. Worthless.
