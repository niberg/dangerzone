Facebook discriminates

We run an alternative online dating site and tried to boost a post from our Facebook page. They refused to boost our post and when we asked them why, here's what they said:

"To ensure a positive experience for everyone on Facebook, ads for dating sites and apps are only allowed from approved advertisers through a direct sales partnership. We hope this change will help encourage greater accountability and maintain the quality of dating-related advertising on Facebook.

This means that you must have prior authorization from Facebook in order to buy dating ads on Facebook. We are not currently accepting new partners at this time, but we expect to open applications for new advertisers in the future.

Thanks for your cooperation,"

Sounds a bit unfair and discriminatory, no? The user agreement covers their behinds somewhere I'm sure but still it's totally lame.
