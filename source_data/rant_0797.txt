Why the fuck did my mom move us out to Bumfuck, Mo?

The place we live fucking sucks. One, if you want to go somewhere, you *have* to get a ride, because we live beside a road that if you want to travel on, you have to drive because if you try to walk on it, you *will* die. Two, I'm bisexual. My mother has known this since before I came out. You know what they have here? Dunce-ass girls with no clue about anything and cornfed, homophobic, racist, and sexist boys. Three. This place is nothing but sticks and leaves. Trees stretch as far as the eye can see. Four. We live at the bottom of a hill. That means no television and no phone service.
