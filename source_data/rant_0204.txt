I hate "tough love" advice in /r/writing

First of all, I haven't personally received this brand of advice in a while. I just hate seeing it.

I mean honestly. Tell me something I *don't* know. I get it, it doesn't matter what media you have available. I get that you should battle writer's block. I get that putting the words on paper (or Word document, whatever) is the most important part. Again--tell me something I don't know.

**"Writer's block doesn't exist. It's just an excuse"**

No, no it's not. Writer's block is a hurdle and you're not supposed to let it trip you. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, not even that you should ignore it. I might even argue that writer's block is healthy, essential, helps you sort out what your message actually is. If *you* make it into an excuse, that's your problem.

**"You need to write x-billion words a week. ~~Bitch get on my level~~"**

No, just fucking write. Word count is incidental. If you start a project with nothing in your head but "Damn I'm gonna impress /r/writing with my word count" you're just shooting yourself in the foot. You can double the word count of a good piece of writing just by converting it all to purple prose. You can write "fuck" 10000 times in a row. Think about your favorite book. Do you like it because of the word count? Do you think the author's primary goal was to fill as many pages as possible? How about this instead: Write whatever you wanted to write, put in your full effort, and when you're done start something new. If it's not novel material then don't write a damn novel worth of words.

**"Just write it and worry about how it sounds later."**

I hear this a lot. What I don't hear as often is what kind of worrying I'm supposed to do later. Yes, you should initially just write it down and not fuss. But that advice only takes you so far. And I've seen it reiterated countless times. What if literary techniques are actually a thing? What if it's important to know how to develop a plot and characters? You can write it all down but face it--you will need to fuss eventually. You will need to fuss a lot. And in the end, it's the diction, the syntax, the dialogue, the imagery, all of those annoying terms you learned in school that matter.

**"Always remember that you suck at writing. You just do."**

Such a circlejerk. What is the point? How does that help me improve? I'll say it once more--tell me something I don't know. Yes it's important to be humble and receptive to criticism. But self-deprecation is a waste of time. Have we forgotten that it's better to just focus on the writing and not on yourself?

**"I had a book published so I have the right to say these things."**

Anyone has the right to say these things. That doesn't make it good advice. And the fact that you wrote a book doesn't make it good advice either.

**Tl;dr: "Tough love" is a pretentious circlejerk that /r/writing uses to feed the ego and avoid giving real advice.**
