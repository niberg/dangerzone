Borderline sexual assault can really make you ten times more suicidal

I'm an 18 year old freshman in college, and I'm on antidepressants and and some anxiety drugs. I thought I would get a little better once I got to college and away from my family (the source of most of my grief) but I just seem to keep spiraling downward.
I'm having a lot of fun in college, I have decent grades, really good friends, my sorority is kick ass but I wish I were dead most of the time. Then last night happened and its made me think about my suicide plan more in depth than I ever have, and that scares me.


Last night I was at a party and I started talking to this guy. One thing led to another and I ended up agreeing to go back to his room with him. [Note that I am extremely drunk at this point] So were walking on campus and he pushes me into this little corner against a building that's hidden by trees. We start to make out, and he insists on me giving him head. Alright, fine, I'll bite (not literally).


Eventually he says he wants to have sex. I say no I don't want to, and he keeps insisting and asking to cum inside me even though I'm not on birth control. At this point I'm nearly passed out drunk in the bed of mulch, and I'm not even sitting up. I tell him I want to go home, but he keeps insisting so finally I gave him a condom so I could get it over with so I could go home.


When I'm drunk it's hard for me to get wet, and that happened last night so it started to hurt really bad. I asked him to stop because it hurt but he wouldn't. Eventually he stopped when it was too dry to hardly do anything with and would't walk me home until I gave him head.


Last night was awful. It's only making my self hatred stronger. I don't want to be alive. I want to die. I feel like it doesn't even count as sexual assault. I think it was my fault.
