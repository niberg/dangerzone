Horror Movies

It's like watching a constipated person squatting. Then the innocent victim decides it would be a good idea to hide under the squatter hoping not to get shit on. After a long drawn out amount of moaning, groaning and screaming the squatter is relieved. The person laying on the floor makes another top knotch decision to open their mouth to gasp only to choke on the violently awful feces that is shot out and dies. And that's a movie.
Yeah, it's just like that.
TL;DR:Horror Movies are boring and shitty
