Rant about private handicap parking spots

I live on a street where many people don't have driveways and try to park as close to their homes as possible. The situation can suck, especially in winter, but for the most part people cope with it. There is no choice except moving. 
Recently a handicapped parking spot sign appeared close to my house. It belongs to a neighbor across the street...we have one side of the street parking. I think he got the spot because an elderly man lives with the family. The family is sort of new to the neighborhood and the old man is a recent arrival. This old man has no trouble walking. I have never seen him get in the family vehicle even as a passenger. Yet his presence in the home must've been enough for the city to grant the spot. 
I am so pissed that this spot is "owned" now and that makes it that much harder for everyone else. It sucks to come down the street and see that is the only empty spot and it can't be taken by anyone else! I would love to find out a way to fight back legally.
