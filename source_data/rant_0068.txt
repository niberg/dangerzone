You are NOT a veteran! Stop lying!

You are not a veteran! You did not serve in a war! You was kicked out of boot camp! You was in the military for two weeks! You made the same 'sacrifice' as a kid who went to summer camp! Stop Lying! Real veterans have fought and served our country. Some were horrifically wounded. Some was killed. But you? You think it's all some damn game to get free food once a year and impress your idiot friends.
