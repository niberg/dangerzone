I think I just need to have a conversation with a random stranger

Uh hi. Im still a bit drunk from last night, so sorry if words are hard right now. Im 22 f have a great job, a place to live and food to eat, but for some reason I want to swallow my 12 gauge. Have wanted to for quite some time, I'm thinking it will happen soon. I'm chicken shit and probably won't. I feel like calling the cops to my house and pulling my glock on them. I'm a horrible person. I don't want to hurt anybody, but the thought of swerving into an oncoming semi on my way to work at 90mph with no seatbelt on is eerily comforting. I have no friends, no family, no life and no reason to keep going. The people I've tried to talk to in the past about depression just tell me to suck it up and there's nothing wrong with me. Physically, yes, but these thoughts can't be healthy. I think it would help if someone can just let me know they read this.. Please.
