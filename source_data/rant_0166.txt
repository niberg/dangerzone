My boyfriend embarrassed me at work.

I just got a retail job in a cosmetics store. It's a small store, and a lot of people come in at the same time, so it's really tight quarters and a little stressful. Today while I was working, my boyfriend and his best friend came in during a rush. I greeted them, described some products, and showed them this tester product. My boyfriend tried to break it. I told him to stop and he wouldn't. I took the tester away and put it down and talked about other products. My boyfriend then picked it up again and tried to break the tester again. I took the product away again, and I got reprimanded for spending too much time talking to customers who weren't going to buy anything. They left, and I went through the rest of my shift embarrassed. I texted my boyfriend telling me he embarrassed me, but he hasn't replied. I feel like crap, and I just want an apology. He never acts like that, and he knows I'd never embarrass him like that. I don't know why he tried to break my products. I don't want him to ever go back to the store. I'm so embarrassed.

Update: My boyfriend replied, half apologized, and said he wouldn't have embarrassed me if I paid attention go to him. You see, the only reason I didn't pay attention to my boyfriend is because he wasn't talking about the products. His friend was, so I directed my attention to someone who I thought would buy a product. And now I'm the bad guy because I tried to make a sale.

Update two: I forgot to say one thing. While I was on the floor attending to the both of them, my boyfriend accidentally touched something sparkly. Rather than wiping it on his jeans or asking for a tissue/towel, he kept trying to touch my face. I kept telling him to stop but he didn't. Is that harassment?
