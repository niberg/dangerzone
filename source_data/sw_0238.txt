4 days 14 hours

4 days 14 hours. That's how long i have left. Saturday the 15th of November.

I've made up my mind and i'm sure it's the right decision. I finished school 2 years ago and since then my life has just gone to shit. I didn't get into any of the universities i wanted (none at all actually), i started drifting apart from my friends, i couldn't find a job, i even fell off a fucking cliff and broke my leg.

I've tried to pick myself up. I kept telling myself things will improve, and they do for a bit but then get worse. I've gotten and lost 4 jobs, i've been doing a course to get into uni but i'm failing, i'm in massive debt to different people, i did get involved with a girl for a few months but i fucked up and hurt her on accident and as a result she deleted me from her life. I went out and found someone else but she's just stopped talking to me.

I know things aren't going to get better and even if they do, it'll only be for a few months at most.

So in 4 days i'm going to a surprise party for a friend in the city. After it's done, instead of going home i'm going to go to some sea cliffs and do what should have happened the first time i fell. The next few days will be me tying up loose ends i guess.
