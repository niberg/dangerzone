I've given life a fair chance...

This Friday I will be 25 years old. A quarter of a century. 25 full trips around the sun. And I have absolutely nothing to show for it. The only person that ever understood me, that I ever remotely mattered to, died in my arms on Mother's Day of 2010. My life is a cruel joke. Ever since my Mom's passing, I haven't had a single feeling, not a single emotional response to a goddamn thing. 4 years of pretending to be a member of the human race. Faking smiles at joyous occasions, feigning sadness when it felt appropriate. I'm so tired of pretending. I'm on a treadmill. Stagnate. I've tried reaching out to people, but no one understands how I feel. People tell me I just need to change the things in my life that make me unhappy? How can I do that when there is nothing that makes me unhappy? I would fucking kill to be sad right now, to feel anything. So, I've decided to throw in the towel. This Friday will be my last birthday. That seems appropriate for some reason. Leaving the world on the same day that I entered it. I don't know why, but just having a date set in stone feels comforting. I'm leaving this here ahead of time so if anyone cares to look into anything after I leave, they can find this and know this wasn't just a spur of the moment decision. This is something I've wanted for a long time. I'm not in pain, I'm not suffering, I'm just done. I'm going to spend the remainder of this week trying to bring joy to anyone that I encounter. Maybe I can at least make some minor changes for the better in this world before I go. I wish I had the resources to straighten up my affairs, financially and legally and what have you. I'll do my best.
