I'm exhausted.

My dysphoria is spiking out of control and I regret not transitioning when I was younger at least not trying to. My body is covered in scars and I look like a freak. I've been on hormones for almost a year and I have as much progress as most people see in 1-2 months. I grew up abused and I've been raped before. I can't remember a time where I wasn't suicidal so it's a surprise I've even gotten this far. I was forced to be isolated from everyone. I wasn't allowed friends or to go to school. I've been alone for nearly 10 years now and I'm only 21. I just can't keep it up. I've tried and tried and I've given it my all but I think it's time to call it done. I have an infected tooth decaying in my mouth that I can't get removed so I'm in pain daily. My doctor recently refused to test me for some medical issues but she's no different then my other doctors really. I've always had medical issues and no doctor has ever bothered to try and answer them. I've decided I'm going to end it soon. I don't even know why I'm posting here honestly. I don't really want help. Years and years ago I wanted help but now I'm done.
