I'm losing control.

I have been forced to give up something that is very dear to me. And that thing is me, or at least my physical form.

I was 5'6" and 106 lbs. It was hellish to maintain, but I did it. I was 167 lbs years before too, so I got here on my own. No drugs (for weight loss) no tricks. All me. It was my greatest accomplishment. And I liked how I looked.

I'm being forced to gain weight now. My boyfriend is encouraging me to lift weights and tone up, but all that translates to is "GAIN FAT". And I'm done. Literally, I can't take it anymore, here is where I throw in the towel. From being underweight for so long, suddenly my body is craving everything. I've been eating around 2,000-2,500 calories now per day, which is slowly but surely causing weight gain. I'm probably 110+ lbs at the moment

Today, I confess my sin: I just finished 5,000+ calories. Wouldn't be surprised if it was closer to 6,000. And I'm very close to ending my own life. I lost my leaner frame and I don't want to live a life where I'm in a different body.

I'm shaking, in severe stomach pain, wishing that this could kill me (in some cases, it can) I have to face extended family tomorrow and they'll see how disgusting I look. It's been a long time since I've considered suicide, but now it's the only exit from this binging that my life has become.

I'm so sorry.
