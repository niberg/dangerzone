ALL YOU ILLITERATE FUCKERS ON /R/WORLDNEWS

About the ISIS/Syrian Kurds/Turkey matter,
All you stupid fuckers are expecting Turkey to just aid YPG/PKK defeat ISIS and help them defend the town of Ayn el-Arab.
What you don't understand is that,PKK/YPG has killed 30.000 Turkish citizens in the last 35-40 years or so, and caused billions of dollars of estimated loss,the southeast part of Turkey is a shithole because of the conflict these animals has brought upon our country.They have abducted our teachers,burned down our schools; which were also built with the tax money of our loyal kurdish citizens they claim to protect and libarate.

And you morons, sitting there comfortably in your seats in USA are judging Turkey because we aren't helping those pigs?
Umm... No.


ALSO: To the people asking why Turkey is still in NATO...You guys probably don't know Turkey lost 718 troops in the korean war, a conflict Turkey had nothing to do with and simply fought because the US and NATO said so.Turkey is probably the most loyal ally of the United States.
