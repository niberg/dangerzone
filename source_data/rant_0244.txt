I thought we had a 0 tolerance for bullying in school! (Update I guess?)

[Part 1 for anyone interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2l3zz4/i_thought_we_had_a_0_tolerance_for_bullying_in/)

So a few days have gone by since I posted that. However, that doesn't stop something even worse from happening. 

Not only have the administrators done *nothing* about kicking that kid out, but today got worse. On a kid's phone, they have an app that shuts off the projector. That kid, we all suspect, is the new kid in the class. It only happened when he came in yesterday and when the teacher kicked him out to the office, it stopped also.

However, the teacher had to threaten the whole class that if it happens again she'd put us all on lockdown and call an administrator down to take all of our phones and search for the app. 

The "leader" of the group I talked about last time had an idea. When class got over today, he went straight over to the teacher's desk and stole the remote to the projector. That's right. **He marched straight over there and took it while she was distracted.** Normally, this would have been funny for some. No one caught it but me, though. So after they all left, I told her about what he did.

She immediately got angry and looked around for the remote. It was nowhere. I knew that he walked off with it. I knew it for sure. So tomorrow, I know exactly what his plan is:

1. Lie about taking the remote (if he's questioned).
1. Make sure the remote is hidden.
1. Turn off the projector multiple times to the point where she gets so upset, she confiscates all of our phones. (This is where I plan on leaving my phone in my locker so I don't have it taken)

I've been told a few times to not interfere anymore (by my friends). Should I keep trying to get him kicked out or should I call it quits?
