Maybe I am wrong here. (not urgent)

So maybe I am wrong in this Subreddit, but I read some of the posts here and thought there might be a piece of advice here for me.
I guess there's something wrong with me: I've got a good live, very good friends, no traumatic memories nor a bad childhood. Also there are a lot of moments where I am very satisfied with my life, but on the other hand I got these really severe "downs" where I seriously want to end it, that alone wouldn't be that bad but the last months those "downs" appear more often and I am getting a little bit afraid when I am thinking about it in my "clear moments" . Also when I am feeling happy I think of a good method how I could end it and while I am in one of those "downs" I am always very close to it. But no matter how much I think about it I can't find a real reason, just the urge to end it. I just get the feeling that I am not interested in life as it is anymore. I am pretty sure I haven't got a depression, but what is it else? I often got situations where I was very close before commiting suicide but I don't really have a reason to do so? Is this just a normal condition, that every human has or is there something wrong with me?
 
Sorry for my english and maybe this post doesn't belong here but maybe someone here can help me with this matter or tell me where I should post this instead.
