Can't do it anymore

So I'm 23 years old been depressed for 5 years with the last 2 being the worst. I've changed from the class clown in high school that loved to make people happy into someone that can't even go to a classroom anymore without wanting to run away home or just stare at the ground hoping no-one will notice me until I get to be back home so I can start drinking. I think I might be suffering from social anxiety but I'm too scared and I just don't care anymore. I've pushed all my friends out of my life and I can't even make friends like how I used too. I've just become so numb to everything and everyone . I can't feel anything and I don't even think I'm real anymore. I don't know how things got this bad, I've always thought about suicide but I've always told myself I'd get better and that I couldn't do it to my family. But I've given up already I just didn't know it , I've been dead all these years and I dont care about my family or anyone anymore. Tonight will hopefully be the night I can finally be at ease
