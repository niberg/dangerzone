Just ugh

Today I had a pathophysiology midterm worth 40%. I had everything down pat. I knew it all. I got the exam and felt so nauseous and I wanted to puke. I could not believe how I was feeling as I was working my way through the questions I just started to feel less and less confident. I have a learning disability and I have never felt so let down with it as I did today. All my knowledge departed my brain and as soon as I past through the doors when I had finished I remembered everything. Thanks for listening reddit. Just needed to vent.
