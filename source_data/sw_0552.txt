When I don't use social media I get healthier

Facebook specifically. Two of my friends have already killed themselves and I can't help but notice the obvious role that our social network through Facebook is all but entirely responsible for this crap.
I'm much happier without facebook, snapchat, instagram, dating websites, etc. It reminds me who my real friends are. I still post music on SoundCloud, but my goal is to have somebody else release my music for me.

I actually like people. I don't see then as the problem, but technology doesn't help me express myself or communicate effectively.

I sincerely hope this helps people.
