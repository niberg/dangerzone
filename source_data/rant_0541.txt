BC Transit needs to get it's shit together. Not even the skytrains this time.

I am a student currently between classes at a university a city over. This means an hour long bus ride each way, and a lot of counsellor appointments to get my classes and government grants sorted out. Sure would be nice if I could make it to half of those appointments. Not having a car, I rely on taking a bus that doesn't even show up 75% of the time. It's to the point where it's an amazing event when it DOES show up AT ALL. I frequently go and sit outside in the wind hours early because I KNOW that's the only way I even have the slightest chance of getting to where I need to go at all. And once again, it has failed to show up, and I have missed an appointment. I know the schedule, when that thing SUPPOSEDLY comes for each day of the week. And it is NEVER THERE. And of course, sending in complaints or reviews or whatever is meaningless to them. They're the only bus company here, doesn't matter if they're shit, because BC Transit is the only option.
