[Gaming] IGN are IGNorant bastards

Just look at the review for Fat Princess. If you want to watch it, all it describes are the menus. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE CREDITS SCENE, YOU STUPID FUCKTARD. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR WHERE YOU WENT LAST SUMMER, JUST TELL ME ABOUT THE FUCKING GAME. YEAH, HAHA, "Play with Yourself", YEAH, THATS NOTABLE.

Look at the review for it's PSP port. It drops the score by 3 for having limited online functionality, and it doesn't mention the four new gamemodes, the two new settings for each map, the extended Singleplayer campaign with double the levels, and the rediculous amount of extra maps.

If you say "oh its an opinion", yes, it's an opinion. An opinion which costs money, money which is time, time which is life, unemployment. You may think i'm taking it too far, but the one to make or break a game is the most visited reviews site.
