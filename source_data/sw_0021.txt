I want to escape

I'm sixteen and I know its cliche and silly to be talking about throwing my life away. I'm lucky, privileged, you know the spiel as well as I do but I'm not particularly satisfied. In the last couple years I've had some mental struggles (here's a list of diagnoses - Bipolar 1, OCD, ADHD, OCD, Anhedonia, Major Depressive Disorder, et cetera, obviously some are incompatible and whatnot because different shrinks for different thinks). I'm ambitious enough that it feels like a millstone weighing me down thinking about the futures I've washed down the drain in the last couple years. The one thing I've found respite in for the last couple years of high school has just become another sphere of conflict. Even if I could love that activity again I don't have the grades to continue it after high school - but I'll have to watch each of my friends go on and enjoy it and thrive. All I've wanted for a long, long time is to be alone, in bed and warm, and I think that's what death will be. Right now I'm too scared to go but I want to work up the courage.
