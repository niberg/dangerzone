My mother hates the one thing that I love (advice welcome)

I love snowboarding, it is my one passion. I literally look for ways for me to snowboard at all times, and the best part is I am good, I'm not trying to brag but Ive won competitions and People call me the best boarder at the place I work (Monarch). So you would guess my family would be supportive. Which my brother and my stepfather is, but my mother on the other hand tries everything in her power to get me to stop. I struggle in school, and when I say struggle I mean it, I devote alot of time trying to keep my grades above D's because If they are a D or lower I can't snowboard. However The one motivation I have gets ruined alot because even when my grades are good my mom won't let me go snowboard. Even now when I am working at monarch and paying my way in gas money she sometimes doesn't let me go. Which really ruined every reason to keep my grades up.

Here is a few other things you should understand 

I hate my mother I have since I was around 9 and I am 16 so this isn't just some teenage anger

I don't plan on going to college. I have no reason to I have my career planned out and in the works (working with my friends mother in her store and continuing to snowboard until I go pro or have enough money to start my own shop)

I have companies looking to sponsor me 

I have honestly tried to figure out a way to just start my career plan now.
