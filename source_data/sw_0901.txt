halloween suicide

I can't carry on anymore. 
I'm only 23 but I've grown to hate myself and my life is full of constant regret. I seriously sat at my desk today and wrote out my suicide note. Meanwhile, all of my coworkers are happy celebrating Halloween. Every fucking day is horror for me. Every day is a constant reminder of me not being enough. I'm ending this tonight. I want to feel the edge of this knife on my skin. I want the pain to end. 



Thank you and good luck with your lives.
