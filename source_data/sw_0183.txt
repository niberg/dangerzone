im scared it wont work.

hi my names andrew, ive been feeling really shit for about 3 months siince the love of my life for the past 5 years decided she didnt want to be in a relationship with me and she couldnt tell me why. we still talk but its just heart wrenching talking to her knowing she doesn't feel the same way as i do. i took LSD two months ago and threw myself off a bridge.. it wasnt high enough.

my current situation is awefull my parents live abroad in germany as my dad is serving in the army and i live with my grandparents, my gran has bad dementia and my papa has cancer, it sounds selfish but its an awefull place to be right now. i cant stop thinking about killing myself, i feel like nobody cares i want to see what they say when im not here anymore this is really selfish of me i know.

this is my final step, my last chance.. my only hope really.

ive decided to tomorrow im going to sell everything i own that has any value my computer included so we can all just pray this works for me. after i sell everything im getting a bus ticket to holland from glasgow where my best friend lives and is letting me stay for a short time till i get my head round things.. he just doesnt know how fucked up i am on the inside right now though.. were going to look for a job for me as soon as i touch down anything cleaning dishes even if i can find a job i can contact a family member to ask them for a months rent and pay them back with what i earn. this is it. hopefully my new life where i can forget about my past.

i dont know why im posting here, attention maybe.. thoughts maybe. i guess im really crying out to anyone that can help me right now.
