Rejection from loved one, then friends, now father. I dont know where to go.

Ive been depressed for a little while now, not too bad, but still yet so.  A girl I loved broke up with me, and I was a mess.  Then she said to try again, but couldnt and hasnt texted me since, so we broke up. (Im 18).  Because of that I cant see my few good friends anymore because they are her best friends, and I cant be around her or I may break down.  I told my Dad I was depressed, he put me in therapy.  (which really helps).  He tries to help me, but it doesnt help at all, makes it worse.       .           Recently I snuck out of the house to go to a party (Im a senior) and he found out, was pissed, and said I lost all his trust.  Then he said I need to change or will fail in marriage later.  I then (under instruction from my therapist) told him i really apretiate his help, I really do, but he isnt helping, and that I prefer if we leave this topic to the therapist.  He turned to his computer, and I asked why he stopped tlaking, for we were having a fruitful conversation about trust, and I would like to continue, just not on the topic of my therapy.  He then yelled YOU DONT WANT TO TALK TO ME APARENTLY.  and said he doesnt know me anymore.

.        Rejection from my loved girlfriend, outcast from my few good freinds, and now rejection from my dad.  I dont know what to do, I even thought of killingmyself.  I dont know what to do.  Any advice is greatly appretiated.  Thanks
