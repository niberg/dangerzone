Tired of All This Shit

I have spent about five years, helping my wife with depression and preventing her suicides while all the while hiding my own depression and suicidal tendency. We got married when I was 20, I am 25 now. There is no more love from me to give her anymore. I work day in and day out, I feel nothing for her only to try to give her some form of happiness, I have constantly thought about ending it all and sometimes I have to try very hard not to yell at her to go ahead and do it, and that I might just join her.

I have no focus, no more desire, I am quite lacking in caring. And I wish I could turn back the clock. Live a more fulfilling life, away from my wife where i don't have to contently support her for her depression. I'm tired of it, and tired of having nothing else.
