Life is absolutely amazing

As I write this, I share this time with you. YOU! A person I have never met, likely. There is this middle ground of a life I have and a life I share with you along everyone else alive now. Far away there is life happening simultaneously but cannot be perceived by me now on another planet and will not be seen by the spot I am on for millions of years after its death and, even then, it will be a forgotten speck of light, dismissed and called a piece of maybe Orion, a dead god we made up ages ago. Meanwhile, in the dark corner of the room I am in, bugs and organisms crawl and cajole, they mate and conspire for their own little world of wars and victories. How foolish are we all that we do not understand that we are made from stars, that we are forged from something that was made, lived for ages and had life around it before it then died and made us? We are the universe perceiving itself, a collective consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. How is life not worth living? You are absolutely precious. I love you. How can I not? I share this with you. Life is absolutely amazing.
