I don't think I'd ever actually hurt myself, but I actively wish to die

On paper my life is great. I'm regularly taking my meds. I know I have lots of friends who love me. But I feel so alone. I don't know how to cope and I can't stop crying.

My reasons for not killing myself are mostly vanity and administrative. But I'd be pretty happy to be hit by a bus.
