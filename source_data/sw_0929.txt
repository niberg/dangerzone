Going out on top

I had a romantic affair with my best friend. 

Now that friendship, my only real friendship that lit up my life, is gone forever. Forever marred by my actions.

My wife did nothing to deserve what I did. She does not know, but I know it will de estate her.

My life was seemingly perfect. But I am not the good man everyone thinks. My successes have been luck. Everyone thinks I am special and a role model. Well, they are wrong. I've lied and cheated and been lucky. I'm so far beyond flawed.

I can't look my wife in the eye knowing what I've done. There is nothing for me now. I've adulterated my life away.

She'll be better off without me. I'll have gone out in my prime, before anyone realizes what I really am.
