This is dumb but its been accumulating for the past 2 years or so.

Jesus fucking tit christ,
 I've taught all of you many god damn times on how to use computers. How are you ALL fucking clueless? You're all younger than I, you should be better! Sure, its only a couple years younger, but come the fuck on.

 You, especially you, I've literally been to your house 6 times in the past month fixing your shit tier PC that you consistently fuck up in some dumb ass way, fucking FIGURE it out, its not my fucking fault that you bought a prebuilt after I told you a 100 times "They fuck up, let me build you one". 

Also, use some god damn common sense when I send you a how to on something you're stuck on, actually read the fucking thing, or watch it, don't keep asking me "yeah but you can just explain it" I got school, homework and a job, unlike yourself.

 Unlike all of you. Just please, fucking read the read me once, just glaze over it, or Google the fucking problem. I got a shit load of crap to deal with. I don't want to spend my days off trouble shooting all of your PCs. God dammit, how fucking hard is it to learn the basics of computers. You all spend 12+ hours on them playing games and watching porn for fucks sake. 

/sorry/
