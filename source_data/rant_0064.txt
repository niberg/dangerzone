and again FU Time Warner

Just got home from work, Cable works, no Internet call and here there is a planned cable outage in my area for TV and DVR...so while I am watching TV and waiting 20+ minutes to find out why I have no internet, I finally talk to a nice young woman who tells me how lucky I am not to be part of the outage for TV, ARGGGGGGGGG
