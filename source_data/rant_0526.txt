I wish I had a car!

So I finally got a job. However, I have to get a drug test done first and I have 24 hours to do so. Except, I don't have a car! There is absolutely no one that can give me ride (I have asked everyone I can think of!). There is a bus system, but I don't even have a dollar for that!!! Now I'm afraid I won't get the job for sure because I can't get to the drug testing place! Fuck!!!!
