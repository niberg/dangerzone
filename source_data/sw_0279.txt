Keep finding myself coming back here

I dont have a plan. Dont think I will ever do it. It just seems like I should. I dont want to. I really dont. I hate myself for even thinking about it. I just dont want to be this. I dont want to be what I've become. Everyone that gets anywhere close to me I either bring down or they use and abuse me. I am such a kind and gentle soul. But I have no nerve. I cant help myself or ask for help ever. Every time I open up I'm either shown a mirror or told I dont need help. I know I do but I just cant bring myself to seek it. Im stuck in limbo. This disease of the mind is tearing me apart. Im not going to do it. But I feel like I really should do it. I know I wont so I probably shouldnt even be posting here. But just the way I feel compels me to post here. I want to do it. Only reason I do is to stop being a burden. I am to every single person in my life. I dont help in any way. I'm just a shell of a person. I'm like black hole sucking every bit of light around me. The shitty thing is... every single person tells me how amazing of a person I am... how I am always happy... how I brighten up the room blah blah blah... not one fucking person knows me.... I just hate that. I can never explain one thing. I have an amazing happy experience and I try to explain it... I cant even express myself. Same goes with the pain I go through. I just dont know what to do anymore and I want to stop hurting the ones closest to me. It's the only solution I can see. But... again... I wont even do it........ too much of a coward too concerned with my loved ones just too scared. So I sit here in my own mind with no one to turn to in agonizing pain. At least I get to tell some one (even though youll never know me)
