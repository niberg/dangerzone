You were happy with the thermostat at 68, but now you want it at 75?

What the fuck? I thought we agreed that 68-70 was good. And now you're jacking up the temperature to 75 all the time. Why? 75 is hot for me. I'm sweating at 75. I wake up several times in the middle of the night at 75 even naked with no blankets on. The most I can do is crack the window and turn on a fan and even that isn't enough. Meanwhile you can easily put on a jacket or a blanket if it's too cold for you. I'm willing to compromise and keep it set somewhere between 70 and 72, but 75 is just not okay. 

And why are you fucking lying about it? "The thermostat just dropped down to 62 while you were gone, I had to warm it up!" That's a load of horseshit. And if that's true, then why do you keep putting it back up there? Fuck you. Fuck your passive aggressive bullshit. If it's too cold then tell me and we can compromise, but I can't work with you if you're going to lie and be stupid about it. I'm gonna go sleep in the lounge, because this is ridiculous.
