I hate life

I cant deal with how much stress is on my back. School is too much for me, no helps me at all. I scream to myself because of how much stress I am in. I cant focus at all, so that's not helping. Im constantly scared. Scared that someone is watching me, especially when im in my house. I see faces watching in things that shouldnt be there. I hear things that supposbly arent there. I swore on my fucking life that i hear someone talking, but no one beleived me. All those things are adding to my stress. I want to dropout and kill myself. Ive had a past history of depression and anger and its all fucking coming back. I cant take it anymore. Fuck everything this life has offer. Help me.
