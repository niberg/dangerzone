Get a gift receipt!

For the love of all that is good on this earth, if you make a gift purchase then get a gift receipt! I know what you're thinking, you're thinking "oh but they won't return it, they'll love it!" Well let me tell you something honey I have worked retail for six years and I promise you someone is going to try to return their gift. And guess what? Stores, except for giant corporate took over 'Meric store, are making it harder and harder to return things. My job, a small children's clothing store, has a strict "No Receipt, No Return OR Exchange" and I'm sorry for you, the customer, I really am, but there is NOTHING I can do for you without a receipt and I am TIRED of getting yelled at for it. We have a very generous return period during the holidays, January 15th with a receipt, so please please please America, while you are Holiday shopping this year, GET A GIFT RECEIPT.
