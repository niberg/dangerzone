Is there a sub where i can write about something bad that happend - I don't want to disturb these posts -

I'm sorry to write this here. I was wondering if there is a sub where you could just write about your feelings or things that happened that you want out of your head. It's not exactly venting, more just like you don't have a friend and need to express it. I'm not even sure I can, but it stays in the back of my mind and I might be able to write what happened. 

Depression isn't exactly right, more like bad experiences. Sorry if this doesn't make sense.
