THE CORPORATE HIRING PROCESS!!!!

FOR FUCKS SAKE, HOW DOES IT WEEKS TO FIND OUT IF SOMEONE IS THE RIGHT CANDIDATE? I do not see how hard it could be interview the prospective canidates over a few days, deliberate for a day or so and have a decision back within a week?!?!?! Saying we will let you know if a few WEEKS is NOT FUCKING ACCEPTABLE. People should know sooner if they are going to get a job, especially if it is a job across the country, people need to plan things out, get off your fucking fat asses, work to get interview done, and let people know, it is not a fucking hard concept, this "well we are still interviewing candidates over the next few weeks, and we will let you know" BULLSHIT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE
