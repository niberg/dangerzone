Amazon Canada is BULLSHIT.

I ordered the EVGA GTX 970 SC ACX 2.0 Video Card from amazon and when I ordered it amazon said that they had it in stock and it would arrive on Nov 6/7th. A few days after I ordered it I noticed amazon still hadn't started shipping, so I was a bit suspicious, but I figured it was just slow. Then a week past and amazon still hadn't started to ship it. At this point I contact costumer service to is what this was about. When I told the costumer service guy (Let's call him Bill) about my problem Bill told me that when I ordered the gpu they were out of stock (Even though I saw with my own eyes it was in stock) and that it would start shipping (Not arrive, but **START SHIPPING**) on Nov 25th, and I told Bill what the hell and about how it was in stock when I ordered it. Then Bill told me that it was out of stock when order it and gave me $10 of my next purchase as a "Shut the fuck up" gift. Then I went on pc part picker (A site to help build PC's) to check the stock and I find [this].
