Pro Ana People are Morons...

Any pro-ana/pro-mia/pro-whatever-the-fuck who honestly believes that they can achieve beauty by robbing their body of nutrients or puking their previous meal up is a goddamn fool. I don't even see HOW one can even comprehend that completely-misguided idea. I'm at the point where I think that anybody who thinks that being anorexic or bulimic makes them beautiful--to the point of asking how they can fucking get BETTER at it--is the complete opposite of their goal: An unattractive, selfish pig filled with self-loathing. Jesus, maybe there should be a mass purge, with this type of person being considered for extermination. 

Note: GF is recovering from an eating disorder, and doing extremely well. Occasionally, however, I will catch her visiting MyProAna.com and it fucking rips my heart out. I helped her into recovery, and I plan on staying with her, though I hope I don't break or something if she is never sucessful in recovering. I don't know if I could take it... 

Thank you, Reddit. End rant.
