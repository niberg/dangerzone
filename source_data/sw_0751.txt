Tried hotline so many times, never got through. I need help with this.

So I posted my story some time ago... And things are finally catching up with me. People are starting to suspect the double life I'm living. I'm a 'student' at University but actually my application got bounced this year because of bad grades I had last year. 
If I don't figure out what to do by next week, I'll use a rope I bought to hang myself in a forest nearby. However, I do not really want to do this because of the pain it brings to my parents.

I want to know from reddit, is there a way to just escape all your connections and move abroad for a couple of years?
Like is there a volunteer organisation that asks people for multiple years or can I just move out to a different country and try to start a life there?
A few years down the road, I'll probably be fine to return and pick things up again. But I just can't deal with it right now...
