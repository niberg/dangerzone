My stupid hands / laptop / post

I typed up like four paragraphs of something I want to say to people and it gets deleted because I accidentally hit a button. I'm on a laptop and laying down and my big hands get in the way and goof up everything. Like most problems with computers and input, a lot of time it's not the program or the computer. Just a user input error, it's my fault.
