Working in groups sucks

I'm taking this technical communication class at my university that is supposed to teach us how to work with other people and blah blah blah. My group is pretty cool except for one guy. He has a B.S. in psychology and he went to law school "but never graduated" while the rest of us are undergraduates. 

He basically acts like he's a better writer than everyone in our group because of his education and while he doesn't say it you can tell. We have small individual assignments occasionally, and when he gives us feedback he's such an asshole. He outright said that a couple of my sentences were "horrible" and they very well might have been horrible, but seriously give us all some feedback with respect not like an arrogant asshole. He's also said some rude stuff to my partners, but not as explicitly. It's stupid because for the first 3 weeks of school he was the only one that we couldn't get in contact with, and he hardly contributed to the workload.

The ironic thing is that one of the main goals of our class is that we learn how to work with people, and the importance of respecting others, and treating them as an equal. When you tell someone that their work sucks then you're kind of missing the point of the class you curly headed fuck. Go take a shower and trim your nose hair
