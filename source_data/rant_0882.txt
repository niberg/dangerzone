to the lady who turned her highbeams on when i got in front of her on the highway...

I hope you wake up to four flat tires and a dead battery tomorrow morning. 

Seriously, I had my signal on, you sped up so I couldn't pass you, but I needed to get over. I let you pass me, but later in the drive I somehow ended up pulling in front of you. This was not on purpose, and there was plenty of room when I switched lanes...

This psycho flies into the lane next to me, trying to pass me. When she can't, she turns her highbeams on so I can't see. 

What the heck is wrong with you?! You could have killed someone. So again, I hope your car doesn't start tomorrow. I hope you're late for work and stuck in the slowest traffic ever. Jerk.

Road karma, bitch.
