I'm going to die slowly.

19 years old, no friends, family, hobbies, or skills. I am almost 20 and have not even hugged a girl in my life....

I'm a bum, i live with my parents. I havent even left the house for 6 months. Gonna go down and beg some homeless guy to buy me some vodka everyday until I die. 

Going to begin drinking to ease the pain, fuck life.
