Hello, I'd like to talk if you wouldn't mind.

 Hi, my name is Ross. Long time lurker here, looking for some advice.  My girlfriend of three wonderful years just left me, the reasons being a recent move turned our close knit relationships into a long distance one, and she also now interested in someone else. I am in no way mad at her, I just want her to be happy. I'm just lost now, I quite honestly based my existence on her and making her happy, in a not overly smothering way. She was my first everything, and I for her. First kiss, losing our virginities, first time drinking, first time smoking, etc. To be completely honest, I just feel like the Earth has been pulled out from under me and I am now falling through the void. I keep wanting to just end it, and I realize that is rash and dramatic and obviously not the correct course of action, but I am simply unsure how to deal with anything right now. Apologies for the wall of text.
