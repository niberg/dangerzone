I'm so tired and I want out.

I'm just so tired of feeling like this. I've had depression for 8 years now and nothing changes it. Medication, therapy....I just don't want to exist anymore. I'm tired of being pitied all the time by others. I'm tired of faking happiness and sociability. I'm tired of waking up in the afternoon and feeling like a failure. I hate myself for feeling like this when I have no good goddamned reason to. I'm tired of having wasted most of my life sleeping and staying in. There are pills so close....
