My best friend lost his mom recently and I am concerned about his well being.

I am 17 y/o and my best friend lost his mom about a month ago. It has been rough for him as it would be for anyone in his position. Anyways, last weekend he drove off from my house without saying anything and then called me around 12:30 at night telling me he was going to drown himself. After a long, emotional, talk with him I convinced him to come back to my house where we played 2k15 for the rest of the night. 

Fast forward to last night, I discovered he has started taking prescription pain medicine such as Norco and Vicodin in excessive amounts. I spoke with the kids that are supplying him the drugs and they recognize the severity of the situation and have agreed to not supply him with anymore and I also spoke to my school guidance counselor.

However, our tight friend group was going to have an intervention with him about the pain meds, but we don't really know what to say.

**tl;dr** best friends mom died and now he is at risk.
