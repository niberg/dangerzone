I just want my mom to comfort me. I'm in my 20s

When I broke up with my first serious boyfriend and called her to cry about it, after a few minutes she started greeting people off the phone and having a conversation with them. So I stopped talking to wait for her to come back. That hurt. But maybe she just bumped into some old friends. Then she came back to the phone and said, "Sorry, I gotta go! Just bumped into some people I know, we'll talk later, bye!" Didn't call back for another week or so but by then, thankfully I had my friends to support me.

When I make a mistake or fail at work, school, exams, I don't need to hear that it's my own fault that I fucked up. I already know that. You don't have to tell me that you NEED to be the one to tell me that it's my fault because everyone else is too nice. That's not fucking true at all. The world is already telling me I fucked up and that I'm worthless if I make a mistake, that I'm expendable and replaceable. I don't need you, my own mother, to tell me that.

I don't need you to fucking tell me to go pray to God to comfort when you're the only one who reminds me I'm a disappointment, every single day. 

I know I can just get over it, but I want a good relationship with my family. I've tried for years to reconcile but all I get is, "I'm sorry I said that, I'm sorry I told you the truth and you didn't want to hear it." "It doesn't matter if what I said was hurtful or unhelpful, you need to hear it." "It's not my fault you're so sensitive." She tells me I'm emotionally abusing her when she's the one flipping hot cold on me.
