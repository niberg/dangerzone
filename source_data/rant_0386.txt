OKAY I FUCKING GET IT I FUCKED UP!

But fuck me for wanting to fix it. 

No don't respond to my well thought out text message. Don't even tell me to fuck off. Just continue to ignore me. That's fine. I'm chill. I don't care. It don't bother me none. 

What the hell is wrong with people though? If you're upset, fucking say so. Don't ignore them. What the fuck???
