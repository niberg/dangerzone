Why are people such shitty writers/artists?! (two-in one!)

*TL;DR at the bottom.*

I'm a student in a grade eight gifted class, and for Drama we were performing skits based on (shitty) 'scary' stories about the most stupid things (i.e. a little girl with a doll named Lillian who 'tells her secrets' and is totally irrelevant, a garbage man who uses a love potion to make a woman fall in love with him then realizes that he really did love his sad pathetic life, etc.)

The writing was absolutely awful. The people who wrote it were my age, in the grade eight gifted program... and yet my writing is infinitely better than theirs. If anyone cares enough to want examples, I can post some in the comments.

Anyway, I'm talking absolute *shit*. The most complicated words that were used in the stories were words like 'cascade' and 'delicate', with a single word, 'philtre', that was a requirement to be used in them, apparently. 

These stories were supposed to be scary. How is a happy story about how a garbage man realizes that his shitty life is really wonderful scary? How is a happy story about a child labourer being freed scary? How is a happy story about a fairy realizing that her supposed true love was really an asshole scary?

I would say 'Well, not to be conceited, but...' except the whole point of this is that I'm a conceited asshole, as was stated twice previously. I write *good* scary two-page stories, at least for a barely-13-year-old. I write *well*, and it's shit like this that just... really pisses me off for some reason. Only creative writing, though.

So there you have it. If anyone bothered to read to this point, thanks for putting up with my ridiculous whining about how people aren't as good at certain things as me!

*TL;DR: Bad creative writing by my peers is one of my major 'pet peeves', more likely than not because I'm actually good at it.*

And art. A person on a community website, let's just call them X, is a terrible, terrible artist.

I'm talking shitty, 10-second, shaky, badly fill-tooled digital 'art' that supposedly takes two to four hours. I know for a fact that X is a teenager or older.

A 'flatcolour headshot' of a [strange demon beast](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/223/0/8/dragonheada_by_kcatzen-d7uo52q.png) that is supposed to be a dragon? and one of a [person](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/225/b/7/greeneye_by_kcatzen-d7uyygb.png) are used as examples. Something like that costs the equivalent of three dollars.

The most expensive is a 'shaded fullbody', which has awful solid shading and unrecognizable 'animals'. It costs the equivalent of ten dollars.

Not to mention a lot of the examples are blatantly traced from the site's original art.

I make decent art and I would post examples, but I'm a bit paranoid that X might see this post and recognize the art.

I charge jack shit. I get no commissions.

X gets plenty of commissions.

I might sound like a resentful asshole, but hey, I guess I am.
