Im not doing so well

Im 25, and i was fired today. Im not mad, i deserved it. I have no savings, no transportation, no family, no friends, and soon to be  homeless. I've been given so many opportunities, and i've failed at every one. It wasn't bad luck, it was me being a shitty human being. 

I've been talked away from the ledge several times over the past 7 years with the "Give it one more chance, things will be different this time." I tried. I failed. I dont want to do it again. This is the perfect chance. No one in my life will notice, because there is no one close in my life. 

I dont know what else to say in the public forum. I dont want to break any of the rules. I guess ill just say that i want people to remember my in a kindly way.
