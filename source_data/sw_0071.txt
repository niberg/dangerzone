Having Thoughts Lately

I have been in college for almost 4 years now and I still feel like I have no clue what I am doing. Better yet my resume is pretty awful and in less than a year I will be out of college and then what? Everyday I just feel that anxiety creeping up on me and fall on partying and video games to distract me. I just don't see any good outcomes coming my way anymore. Even if I lucked out and landed a decent job, my horrible memory/focus would surely get me fired. All the buildup of confidence I recieved when I found my now ex has eroded away after our breakup and now I am just left with me and my persistent flaws. I don't have the balls to commit suicide now but everyday it seems like a more appealing option.
