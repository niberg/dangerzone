I don't know what to live for

I'm going to try hard to not type a wall of text so that people might read this. I will probably be going to jail in 10 days because I have put off doing my community service and havnt been able to afford paying my fine like I need to. I'm waiting I hear back from a lawyer about getting an extension, which seems unlikely. If this happens, I will lose everything. My two jobs that took my forever to get will be gone. My fianc√© will most likely leave me (she has said this before, idk if it's true or not). My family who I have been disconnected with for years will disown me. I have no friends to speak of. I've let me depression, anxiety, and laziness run my entire life. I hate who I am. I have tried to change but I always come back to being this way. I have a hard enough time not wanting to die as is, let alone after I'm going to lose everything. All I want to do is die, I am a waste of a person
