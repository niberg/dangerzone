Not doing too good, reddit

I've been in a funk for a while now. I was in a messed up relationship six months ago. He was emotionally and sexually abusive. He threatened and blackmailed me in the end. I got a message a month ago from his friend, which confirmed to me that he followed through with his threat. I started therapy.
I'm in my first semester of college. I dropped two of my classes and I have to drop one more to save my GPA. I owe my parents $1,000 and I might be losing my financial aid and scholarships.
I don't know what to do to get out of this. I can't bring myself to do what I need to do. I went on a long walk two days ago and I kept thinking about how I could end it and I wouldn't have to worry anymore. That scared me, and I'm still thinking about it.
My mom and dad are telling me to snap out of it, and they want an explanation on why I'm not doing going to class. They know about the therapy, and they know about what that guy did to me.
Dad said it was a lack of discipline and obedience, and that my mom went through worse when she was in college. I just need to get my shit together, I guess.
I was reading a lot of the posts on here and they struck me. I feel like I might be able to put a finger on my feeling. I might be able to describe to them how I've been feeling. I feel like a major disappointment to them, but I don't think they understand fully how this situation has knocked me on my ass. Someone else might be better off in my shoes, but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I don't feel good at all.
I keep looking over at the pills I could take to end it.
I keep thinking about driving my car too fast in this shit weather.
I keep thinking about how I just want to run away from this shit. I don't know if I can deal anymore. 
Anyways, thanks for the rant.
