How did xmen days of future past get 90% rating on rotten tomatoes!? Isn't it just a clusterfuck of hollywood cliches?

There's your stererotypical leader going to "form a team", logan. There's a guy who'll do it not for him but for him, xavier. His sidekick, that warewolf guy. The cool awesome kid with better powers than everyone else who doesn't give much shit but will do it anyway, that time stopping guy. The list goes on. 

And that's just the people! Then there's your typical story plot - trying to save the day by showing gratitude and mercy on the enemy, realizsing your powers and shit, summoning inner stregth with just dialogues, I mean

And I searched reddit for threads like this but couldn't find any. Is no one tired of this stuff already!?

And how the hell did it get that rating on rottentomaties!? Imdb I can understand, it's just fans. But I had respect for rottentomatoies to give rotten ratings to anything that sticks to cliches and today I lost any respect I had for it seeing it give it a freaking 92% rating.
