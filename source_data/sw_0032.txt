Hello everyone

Hi there, my name is Will, I'm a British student who likes History.

I feel that my life has reached an end, I've not washed or slept properly in two months, I'm being ejected from college due to lack of attendance, and my last friend today told me that he couldn't put up with me anymore.

I have nothing left, and I want to go, please help me.
