why cant i just be bubbly buzzin bitch without people assuming im a complete idiot

Outside of university I'm a lot more relaxed. I have two huge last year assignments I'm working on and whenever I'm outside my room or uni, I just become more bubbly. But whenever I let my guard down everyone just thinks I'm an idiot and becomes more patronising. Like can't a girl just be fun?
