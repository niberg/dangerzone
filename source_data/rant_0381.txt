Yeah...you know what...you're *right*. Let's just do away with "political correctness".

Let's just completely *erase* the (already-insufficient) amends we've made in response to *generations* of racial/sexual oppression in this country. Eschew every social filter you have and unleash your *id*; your inner impulsive child; with abandon. Leave business owners to discriminate and exclude potential patrons as they see fit. Ignore the cultural and political superstructures that *continue* to stratify this country and exacerbate the troubling dynamic between between race and class.  Because "you don't *see* colors", right?

Like it or not, *everything* you say is mired in a deep-seated network of cultural archetypes and implications. On a purely-legal level, you're free to act and speak as you please--but you'll *still* have to face the social ramifications. It may seem impossible to eliminate oppressive superstructures *entirely*--but *acknowledging* them, examining your (potential) complicity, and employing genuine effort to confront it can be an excellent place to start. In short: nixing the "n-word" from your lexicon and/or rethinking your "sexy squaw" Halloween costume does *not* constitute a threat to your liberty.

I know this'll get me downvoted to hell (courtesy of this site's "brogressive" status quo)...but damn if it didn't feel good to vent.
