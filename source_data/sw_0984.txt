I think this is it. I'm done.

I'm sorry for posting here so much. I'm probably just bothering you guys sorry about that. I'm just done. I'm not sure I can do this anymore. I want to die. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm so done being sad and whatever I'm feeling because I don't know how to put it into words. I don't know if I'll attempt, probably not, but suicide seems like the best choice right now.
