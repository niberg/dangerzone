One of my close friends told me that shes going to kill herself and there's almost nothing I can do.

I only know her online, but I've known her for years. she has been threatening suicide for a while, but I've talked her into postponing it, but tonight she has told me that she plans to no matter what. I've had a couple friends already over the years that have died on me, and a close friend recently that got hit by a drunk driver, and barely survived, so I cannot handle something like this happening anymore. I don't remember her full name, but I know what State shes in...that's about it. Is there anything I can do to prevent her from doing this?

Here is a chat log of our recent conversation:
