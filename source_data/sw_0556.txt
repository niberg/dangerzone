My mistakes have piled up too high

I've never had a suicidal thought in my life before. But there is just too much happening to me right now and the only solution my brain can find is to end it. I'm scared of what might happen today.

Last month I lost my job and I haven't been able to find a new one. I owe $500 on a car lease that my mom is the co-signer of. But I've been so depressed that I never told her it was past due. Everyday I let it go is hurting not only me, but my mom and her credit. But how do you tell someone that you lost your job and became so depressed that you have been thinking about killing yourself? I'm also in eviction and might become homeless this weekend. I just lie and smile through the pain when I talk to her. I can't bring myself to ask for help. I'm not strong enough. I don't think I'll ever be strong enough. I've been a burden my whole life. I don't want this all to end but today my mom is going to call me because the car lease is about to get into its second month of delinquency. If i was gone then I wouldn't have to feel like this. I wouldn't have to feel anything at all. No one would look at me as a burden or a disappointment.
