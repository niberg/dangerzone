Wanted to be anonymous

So I decided to do the reddit thing after all this time because there are things going on in my life that I wanted to write about without the people in my life knowing it was me.  Well, to bad that immediately the person that I have the most to say about (not all bad) decided to look at my screen to see my user name on the first night I started it.  So now I have to make another username specifically to write about this person.  They did it all while keeping there username specifically secret by saying things like "um, yea...I do that under my username" (instead of saying the name.)  So if you KNOW that sometimes people need anonymity then back off and let us have it!
