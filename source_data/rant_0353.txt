Fuck you and fuck what you did

All the effort I put into us. So much time, wasted. All I wanted was a relationship that worked. But no, instead it turned into something that shouldn't have even been. You didn't even treat me like a fucking person. I was simply your play thing but you couldn't let me go. You depended on me for so long and you couldn't make up your fucking mind so you toyed with me for years. I fell in love with you but now I see that you were selfish and indecisive and I can't get you out of my head. I wish I never met you I wish I never fell for charm and wit and I can't fucking get you out of my head. Maybe I'll find a girl who won't treat me like shit maybe I won't. I'm glad you're gone. You were a parasite. Fuck you.
