I don't see a reason

I don't know what to do anymore. My life just keeps going down. It doesn't seem that way to anybody else, and to most I would probably come off as a bitchy kid. I'm 20, with a girlfriend, a good family, and a good upbringing. I did fine in high school honors and AP courses. Once I got to college, it's been a downward spiral. I've thought of posting on here numerous times, but always told myself that there was no reason to, there was much more to live for. But I feel as though that is just deceiving myself, because in reality I am going nowhere. I am in my third year of college now, after basically failing my whole second year and only earning maybe 7 or 8 credits. I constantly disappoint my parents because I am not living up to the potential that everyone knows I have. They have given me so many chances to get my shit together, believing every time that I am better and am going to do better. But every semester I start to slack off, not do my work, nothing. I fall behind in classes and then become genuinely lost with no idea what to do to get my grades back up. I have been given every chance to do something with my life, and I blow it every single time. It would be better for my friends and family if I stopped being a slacker and just wasn't here anymore. I'm no good for anyone, I just disappoint. I've thought about leaving, just going off somewhere and trying another lifestyle, but I don't even have the balls to do that. I'm afraid I'll leave and immediately regret it, even though I know there is no life for me here. I don't think there is a life for me anywhere. I have enjoyed my life, but I just don't believe I can ever make it as a functional member of society. A light bulb that burns twice as bright only lasts for half as long...I'm just waiting to burn out.
