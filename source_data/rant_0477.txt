I am an idiot.

I have just stopped every contact with a girl I went out a couple of times. Why? Because I am an idiot. Well, here is a explanation. To be honest she is not that pretty. On a scale pretty-medium-ugly, she is somewhere between medium and ugly. We really got along with each other. I could have felt that she had that special thing that could keep me interested in her for a long time. Why I 'blocked' her from the real life? I did it because my friends would laugh at me if they heard that we are in relationship. Other people could also make fun of me if they saw me with her. Yeah I let other people opinions get to me. I thought I was stronger than that. FML.
