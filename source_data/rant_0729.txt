Rant at myself!

Sometimes I think I should just go back to using a Mac. All I've done since I got this PC is get viruses and spyware, and now my computer is telling me my copy of windows is not genuine. I don't even know how I do these things. All I do is get on reddit and play video games. Seriously, how do you mess up a computer this bad when you don't even watch porn on it. First I corrupt a hard drive, now this. Boyfriend keeps telling me it's probably not my fault but I'm pretty sure it is. Don't know how, but I'm sure it is.
