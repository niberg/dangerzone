[Not me] How can I help. One of my family friends daughters had her boyfriend commit suicide, the police found a suicide pact. She's already tried to commit suicide twice.

Title says most. Girl is 15 in a few days. I'm 21. Boyfriend hung himself last night, his parents are flying in from overseas soon. Girl self has, tried to commit suicide twice with tablets. Middle daughter of three daughters. 

Police found suicide pact in boys room with girl. 

I might not be able to get involved personally but I can at least relay some advice to the mum who lives less that 250M from us. 

If any more non-identifying information is required and relevant, happy to provide. 

Any help is great thank you.
