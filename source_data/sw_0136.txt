I have made my decision.

I have an incurable disease that will leave me blind.  There is no cure; that's what "incurable" means.  At best, with the most expensive and humiliating treatment available, I can postpone going blind by a year or two.  And then I will be just as blind as if I'd done nothing, and will have spent all that money and gone through all that humiliation for exactly nothing.

I have nothing against blind people.  I have nothing against people who are happy being blind, or might even prefer it.  Their choice to live with their blindness is *their choice*, and I respect that.

But their choices are not mine.  Their lives are not mine.  What works for them does not necessarily work for me.  What makes someone else happy does not necessarily make me happy.  The mere fact that some other person chose one way *in no way* obligates me to choose that same way.

I do not want to live with blindness.  I do not want to be *forced* to live with blindness.  It is my rational decision, as an adult human being in full possession of my reasoning and faculties, to die rather than go blind.  For the past three months, I have lived with he knowledge that my only options are to die or go blind.  I have considered the implications of everything, and I have sat with my emotions and thoughts on this matter for days and sleepless nights on end.  I take full ownership of my thoughts and full responsibility for my decisions.

I have my method, time, and location picked out.  I have tendered my resignation at work and tied up all loose ends there.  My debts are paid off in full.  My significant other and I are long broken up, and my family made their position on me quite clear when I was fourteen and at my most vulnerable.

This is my choice.  I do not need any of you to approve, but it would be for your benefit if you could accept that.
