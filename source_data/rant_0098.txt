Noisy Upstairs Neighbors

The wife comes in late and it super noisy with her drunk friends. The husband is up early and stomps around for over an hour every single morning. Their son overflowed their bathtub twice in the past three years and both times it flooded down into our apartment. They are currently jamming out to music with lots of bass and it's been almost three hours. They smoke on the back porch even though our apartments are smoke free and while on the porch them and their friends laugh and swear and argue about the stupidest stuff until as late as 4AM some nights. Does anyone else have this problem?! Other than illegal revenge scenarios, what the hell can I do?
