I'm just alone

I cannot connect to people the way a normal human being should.  

People start dating anywhere from middle school up through the rest of their life.  I'm 22M and in college, a senior actually, and I haven't dated yet.  I mean ever.  I cannot make that connection.  I have made a small handful of friends though the years that are more like acquaintances.  One of them is a girl and I've been alone with her for a few moments over the years and it's just weird.  I don't know what to do.  She may like me.  She may not.  I don't know what to do.  I just feel so hopeless.  

I'll be out of college soon and then what?  I work some job where I don't have female co-workers and even if I did you're not really supposed to date a co-worker.  How the hell do I meet women at that point?

I can't drink.  My body makes me feel like shit.  I can't smoke weed I feel like shit with that too.  I don't know what the hell I'll do.  

People just say that it'll all happen naturally.  It doesn't for me.  

Do you know what it feels like to be alone in this world?  With no one that gives a fuck about you like a significant other would?

I'm just going to live and die a lonely sexless fool.
