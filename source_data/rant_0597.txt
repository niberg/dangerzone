I am so fucking sick of coughing, you guys.

Every time. Every single time I get a cold, as long as I can remember. No matter how mild, once the normal respiratory symptoms are gone it's followed up by like 3-4 days of coughing. Not "hey there's some mucus here we should probably cough it up" coughing, but "random bouts of impossibly itchy throat where you don't even have the option of not coughing" coughing. Nothing I try seems to help all that much. By the end of the day my head and throat hurt from coughing, and everyone treats me like I have ebola or something.

I had a not-so-bad cold over the weekend, but now I'm in the coughing phase, and it's as bad as ever. I can feel another tickle starting. Ugh.
