I feel like I need to get this out of the way before Halloween.

No, your comic book styled Archie costume isn't original. Your Harley Quinn outfit tell me that you're a whore. Just because you're a redhead does NOT mean you HAVE to go as Jessica Rabbit. No, you didn't "nail" shit with your outfit. I am not subscribed to /r/aww for a reason, keep your animal abuse in the form of a costume on your pet away from me. 

I'm sure there are over 50 other things that could be added here.
