To the fucking cro-magnons I work with

Seriously, do I have to re-fucking-educate you people on how manners work? I sit at my desk, and have to hear one of you knuckle draggers blather on the phone with a mouth fucking stuffed with food, or ice, and you fucking smack your lips? Seriously? Is this fucking grade school? Then, I go to lunch to relax, maybe play a game of cards, and I have to hear one of you belch, ribbiting while you do so, while there's clientele right in the next fucking room, while also chewing your food so hard, I can hear your poor fucking teeth gnashing together? And the other chewing his food so goddamn loudly, I can hear it in the basement. (I dont really give a fuck if my grammar is horrible in this, I have lost the ability to actually care, for the time being). Seriously, I have to put up with half of my fucking office that doesnt know how to close their goddamn mouths when they eat food.

Edit: Fuck autocorrect, seriously.
