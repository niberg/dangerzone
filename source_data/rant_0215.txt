I dont want to die old

I dont want to live til i need some fucking helper to wipe the shit off of my ass and shower me and feed me my blended dinner that looks like shit and taste like shit because I can't chew or even hold my spoon straight and then get me too bed and repeat the day after, or even worse staying all day long in my old house full of the useless shit that I hoarded during my stupid life that nothings is left of, looking at my wrecked wife sitting in her wheelchair munching on her fake teeth but she doesnt realize that its making this fuckin horrible noise of someone chewing hard candy but thats her teeth but it doesn't matter anyway because I'm all deaf and almost fucking blind and look like ducking death fuck I don't want to be part of this society that keeps its old people alive in the name of fucking ethics and the old people don't even realize they've been brainwashed in believing that its a good thing they get to keep living their misery of life or more of a decades long fucking agony
