Feel like a bad person but

Cannot believe I had to resort to telling you to get lost. I feel bad. I do but you. You are a whole new level of ape shit crazy that I do not need in my life. I spoke to you one time. ONE TIME and you proceeded to bombard my phone like I'm the only person left on the planet. I stop talking and you still continue because in your brain that means sending me pictures of naked you is ok like that's obviously gonna change my mind. Then you proceed to chase me on other apps like that's acceptable behavior for a full grown man. Today was the last straw. You text me and I tell you to get the Fuck Lost. I hope you finally get the hint. I'm sorry to be so damn harsh about it but I didn't know what else to do. I hope you stop. This has been going on for so long now and I'm just so incredibly tired of it.
