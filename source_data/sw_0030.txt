Thought of letting my parents down is starting to affect me

I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past couple years and right now I'm feeling really uneasy. It's my first year at college and I'm blessed to have parents who worked hard and are paying for my education. I'm a huge home person and I'm 5 hours from my family so it hasn't been helping my case. Unfortunately right now I put off an Anatomy paper that will be 10% of my grade to tonight. I can't focus and I'm so worried about failing that I don't know what to do. Considering that they are paying for my education they have high expectations that I will make solid grades but this paper could ruin that. If I fail the class there is no telling how they will feel. I can't bear the thought of telling them that this happened. I can't let them down but I can't focus. My mind is racing. I have pills from when I got my root canal a couple days ago and I'm just staring at them. I know that going out that way can be extremely painful but for some reason I feel ok with that.  Like it's an easy way out. I'm a mess right now. I told my parents that everything is fine but that is far from the truth. I really just want to end it all.
