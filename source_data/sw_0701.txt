Any tips?

So I'm the last person I would expect to see on this subreddit seeing as my life is going nearly perfectly in most people's eyes. I have to admit, I feel kinda guilty posting this here even. I'm currently a physics student at a top-20 rated university in the U.S. I'm heavily involved in an important experiment that my lab is preparing to send into space. My family life is great and always has been. I have many friends, hold officer positions in many organizations at my university, and as of two months ago I got back together with the person I love most in the world after two years of little communication.

Despite all of this, I have been thinking about ways to end my life for about five years now. Even before I came to university. Over the past year though, I've been thinking more frequently and more seriously about how I could go about ending my life in the least painful way; both for myself and everyone else. I even devised a plan where I would disappear into the wilderness and people would have just figured I had gotten lost. 

I really don't know what's wrong with me. The only thing that has kept me from completing one of my plans is the fact that I know I'd make quite a few people upset, and I don't want that. At the same time though, I don't really feel like living. I haven't for several years now. I'm not saying that I'm about to go through with a plan now but the offer seems increasingly tempting. I know that I'm supposed to "look to the future" and expect things to get "better" and the thing is that I'm sure they will. Even my experience so far has shown that my life has gotten "better" with time. Even though I know this, I still don't have the motivation to live. I don't get it. 

TL;DR: I've been considering suicide for years but haven't yet because I don't want to hurt people who love me. Looking for tips on how to survive.
