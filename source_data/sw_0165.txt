In tired of being empty of emotions, it has become so boring

The thought of killing myself has never been a desirable end to me, sounds way to easy I would probably prefer to die in a gun fight or something dramatic like that because I'm tired of this boring life.  I'm tired of feeling nothing, nothing excites me, I don't like human connect. I personally have always preferred the company of animals better than people but that's not why I'm here. I'm here to tell you about my experience of this life in chronological order. These are the experiences I've had that have made me the person I am today. However I can not complain about my experiences because thousand of other people have gone through the same things I have. 

1) I was molested by my brother at the age of 4-6 

2) I got mad and choked a girl in my preschool because she was laughing at me age 6 

3) my cousin also molested me  age 7-9 

4)  I was bullied and beaten up at school on a weekly basis because I was a loner 
Age 10-13

5) I was arrested for selling cigarets at my school, age 14 

And here i am a 16 year old teen boy who battles daily with an emptiness no amount of any can fill not sex, people, power, or possession can fill. The funny thing is that I think I hold no hate, remorse, or feeling towards anything that has happen to me.
