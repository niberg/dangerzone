Why should I give a shit?

"Think of your family and freinds!" So? I could honestly care less about them, even my close friends, could even give a less of a damn about my family. 

"You're young still, you have you're whole life ahead of you" Yes, assuming of course things do get better, which I highly doubt that. I've been telling myself that for the past 4 years and if anything it has got worse.

"But you're becoming a programmer! They make a lot of money and you like doing it I thought?" You're right, I do like it, and I'm good at it. However, it still doesn't change the fact that statistically speaking, the lose of one person isn't that bad especially when I could be easily replaced. Valuable? Yes. Replaceable? Bigger yes.

"But you're unique!" Yea and? You're right, there is only one me, but there are more other unique people that are probably better than me with what I do. Uniqueness doesn't equal usefulness. 

I've seriously just stop giving a shit anymore. All it feels like right now is that I'm just delaying the inevitable. I've given myself until the age of 25 (4.5 years from now) for things to get better. If they do, great. If not, oh well, no real lose.
