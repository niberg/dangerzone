Current state of R/anime and a particular user who is ruining it for me

I'm really starting to hate that it's being flooded by this jordy guy's bullshit. He got all big headed by the best girl contest, which was a huge attempt at karma whoring in my opinion. I mean why the fuck was it like 40+ parts long??? And then he started treating it as his personal blog or something with things like "today, in addition to voting for best girl part 32, you can ask me whatever questions about myself and I'll answer." Like no one fucking cares who you are. Thanks for putting on this contest, I know you went through a lot of hard work putting it together, but seriously... This does not make me interested about your personal life. And then he started advertising that he was writing some story about the best girl contest? Oh, and the straw that broke the camel's back was when he advertised that he was trying to become a mod for r/anime in one of the best girl contest posts. Seriously?! Please no.

And now he's karma-whoring again and treating it like a personal blog with the whole anime debate shit. Does he really care what people have to say about 20th century vs 21st century anime? Or was he just using the thread as an opportunity to share that he asked a girl out. What does that have to do with anything? I'm glad that the attention you've gotten on reddit has apparently inflated your self worth but this is not relevant to r/anime! Go get a tumblr or something. Jesus Christ.
