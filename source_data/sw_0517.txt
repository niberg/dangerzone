I'm not suicidal, but I have a question.

I'm a depressed individual. But I'd never kill myself or someone else. I feel like I have much to look forward to in life, so much I've yet to experience or see. Because of my beliefs, I have no after life, no solace in death. My only time is in the here and now. And because of that, I feel like I will never kill myself, despite how bad things are or how bad they get. 

But I think about suicide. I wonder if people were like me at one point. Where they say they'd never do it. Does anyone have any insight? I don't know if this is exactly the best place to post this, but I'm not sure of anywhere else.
