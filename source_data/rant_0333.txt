Just letting off steam here - ignore.

Spend hours trying to solve friends relationship. All is good, they thank me for it then argue again and ruin it within an hour. I felt good for helping them but I guess I didn't. Then I'm playing games with friends to take my mind off it, computer kicks me off. Dad has set up computer to kick me off at 11. Sit here like a little bitch and a brat for an hour wasting his time because he doesnt want to sleep knowing im still awake. I guess because he loves me but its too late to go back now. Oh by the way the girl I helped with the relationship led me on about liking me and I wasted soooo much time on thinking we had a chance. Now she wont even talk about her feelings to anyone - like thats gonna fix it..

My dad even came in to tell me how i have no life outside of gaming and this was meant nicely but basically felt like him calling me a failiure bexause i "waste" time on my computer instead of doing work. I love commentating the games i play and that would be my dream job and my dad lets me do commentate still but its just a dream so will never happen.

Instead I am forced to go uni with money already saved to give me no choice but to go uni - otherwise i am dissappointing compared to successful brother who got into top 5 uni in country for engineering, has better social life than me and better at games AND even better with girls. So thats nice.

Im done now reddit. I am very sorry if you read all this as it's probably just emotionally driven bullshit but I just have to put it out somewhere
