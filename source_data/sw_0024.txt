If it wasn't for my family..

I wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for them actually caring about me.

I'm so depressed and broken. I have no friends outside of online friends I met through video games. I'm not very attractive (well, at least I think anyway.) I'm the most uneducated, unintelligent person that exists on this planet. I'm not aware of the present political affairs between the U.S and other countries. If I learn something in school, I quickly forget it or most of it within a month or two. I don't have really any redeeming qualities. I don't have good grades, mainly because I'm so demotivated and insecure. I have nothing to live for. The *barely one* relationship I had was long distance and it didn't even work out. I'm home-schooled, so it's not like I can just go out and meet random people. I *plan* to go to college, but I doubt I'll meet anyone there. I don't have any hobbies. I'm disturbingly indifferent in most situations, that I can't even make a career choice. I was hoping to become and engineer, even though I doubt I'd make it, but I lack creativity and I doubt a mindless person like me could ever make it there. I don't have any self-discipline, and I'm just and overall waste of cells who will not provide anything beneficial to the world. I don't see a reason to live, and that is why.
