Life is not going too great at the moment.

For the past 3 months I have been idly contemplating suicide almost every night. These thoughts would begin with how convenient it would be for everyone if I was no longer around. But each night I would conclude that it would be a hassle for people that would have to deal with the funeral and all that jazz.

All of this suicide stuff is caused by my vertigo. Due to the vertigo, I am usually just constantly dizzy. But whenever effort is required to get through the day, it causes uncomfortable migraines, difficulty seeing, and occasional loss of memory. This whole ordeal has been going on for 3 years and it has gotten to the point where I am just fucking tired of it and tapping out of living seems simpler.

The reason I have chosen this time to communicate with others about this (even if they are internet strangers) is because my now ex-girlfriend just cheated on me with my friend. This alone would not cause me to kill myself, but it seems like the push that has made me realize how much of a fucking mess my life is with a verbally and occasionally abusive father and stress that keeps me from sleeping at night.
So any comments on my situation would be a delight, since I've been too scared to leave my bed because I don't know if I can resist chugging the bottle of bleach in the next room.
