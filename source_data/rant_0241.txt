To my room mate\brother in law

Seriously? You want to bitch at me because we're renting the bigger room to someone that actually pays rent?
You don't pay a dime to live under my roof.
 You disrespect the hell out of everyone every time the world doesn't work your way.
You are only here because your brother is my husband.
Ever heard of gratitude? I promise: it's a thing.
But no. You're too wrapped up in whatever is pissing you off today.
It's all well and good for you to say your back hurts and you're not doing anything. And it's fine for you to walk into someone else's room and call them a lazy bastard. And there's no problem with you asking my husband for money whenever you please. But the moment shit doesn't go YOUR way it's the end of the god damn world.
Please: tell us about what you're doing to make your life better? Or anyone else's!
Now's the time to pull up your big boy pants
Accept that people say no.
Get a fucking job.
And quit being such a melodramatic little bitch.
