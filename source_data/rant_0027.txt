Sexism In Modern Society

Before I begin, I'd just like to start by saying I am female, and this is purely my opinions voiced by what I have seen in modern society.

So I've been seeing many groups rising up around my area about protecting/informing females about rape and how to prevent it. But when a man comes into the issue, they outright turn their heads. This agitates me beyond belief. 

MEN GET RAPED TOO. MEN GET HURT AS MUCH AS WOMEN DO. 

I've seen people scoff at a man and label him as a weakling if he claims he is being abused. Many people don't realize men experience tender emotions as well. Men feel hurt. 

And I hate when people try to justify this by saying men are the "stronger sex." What about the women who are seen as "strong" but then break? Why is it okay for a strong woman to break, but if a strong man does it, it's suddenly not okay?
