It's a constant feeling

Like a lot of people here I have been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for years. It is something I deal with everyday (I'm sure a lot of people do as well) and night and in bed I wish I was dead or would die. I wish I would get into a crash on my way to work. My life is has no meaning to me. I go to work at a job I hate and where everyone hates me which is all my doing and I go to school as well to better myself so I can get a better job, make more money and be happy. I don't think I will ever finish school and I'll be stuck working here wondering what happened. Every time I try to do something to better myself something goes wrong. Last semester the week school started my house was broken into and everything was taken, they even took my clothes and just yesterday when I had to take 2 test online my computer died. All these little things are always happening and it makes me so angry. I'm not a pleasant person to be around so I know exactly why I don't have any friends. I'm bitter and mean and take my frustrations out on everyone. I feel the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't want my parents to have to take on my debt. It isn't alot probably about 3k and I have money saved that can cover that that I can leave them.
