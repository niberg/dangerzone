Fucking thieving-ass homeless fuck.

Ok, I try to help out homeless people and such when I can, as I've been pretty down there myself, and it's appreciated when someone can lend a couple dollars or a smoke or whatever. Homeless guy just came into Starbucks asking for money for food, and I got up to help him out. Gave him a couple dollars to buy a small sandwich or something, and he turned and RAN with it. This exact reason is why so many people have problems trusting homeless people. Just, fucking fuck.
