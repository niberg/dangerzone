I'm sick of this. Sick of all of this.

I've dealt with all this crap for about 2 years, and I'm at the point where I am done. My mother is wasting her money on drugs, we're in debt, and we don't have a place to live in a month or so. I haven't eaten inabout 2 days and I can't tell anyone whats going on. My sister already knows, my dad I'm to shy to tell anything and my grandmother, shes a little on the verge to figuring it out. I'm gonna end up going to court for my truancy. And on top of all this, I don't have friends.  I don't have family. I don't have anyone. We are 370- in the bank. I wanna die, so much. And I can't solve my own problems. I just, need something. Someone. Whether its a jar of pills or a smiley face sticker, death himself, or a mental therapy worker, or a friend.
