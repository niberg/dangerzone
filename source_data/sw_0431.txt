[19 m] I think I have to quit now

Nothing is going right in life, even as I do well I can't achieve basic things, I'm lonely, a virgin and I really think it is time to end this. I've kept fluctuating between if I should do it, or if I shouldn't but now I think I know what I have to do. 

You people tried to help me in the past and I appreciate it, you are all fundamentally good people, however some people are beyond saving.
