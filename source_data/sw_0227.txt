I don't see the point anymore

Everything feels like so much unnecessary work. If I didnt have a family or anything I'd have ended it a long time ago. I'm so tired. I can't end it because he'll think it's his fault. I need friends if I'm going to get through this and I dont know how to get them. Everyone I meet seems stupid or does drugs or just isnt like me at all. I need therapy and gave my dad a list but nothing came out of it. I try to think of the future but I can never imagine it because I don't feel like ill be there
