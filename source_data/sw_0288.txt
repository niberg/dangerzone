Well i am done living

I turn 24 tomorrow, i fuck up all my oportunitys to live gorgeous places &amp; had to move back to my hometown to everyone i hate, they now know i cant make it while i be stuck working in the food service industry the rest of my life. I am going out tomorrow to buy a gun off the street with the last of my money to blow my brains out with High Hopes by pink floyd playing. Fuck You God
