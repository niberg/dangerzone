Labor protections in the U.S. are so half assed.

So I have tonsillitis again, which is bad. But now I'm eligible to finally have them removed, which will be good long term. I also just put down a deposit for a cruise in February, and my employer requires you to use all of your sick/vacation/personal days before you can take unpaid time off as FMLA. Apparently there's only one state (Wisconsin) that lets you choose whether or not you want to take your FMLA time unpaid. The rest leave it up to the employer and my company's policy is that you have to use any paid time off before you can be off unpaid. 

Some argue that this is to be an incentive for people to take less leave, but I don't plan on taking less time off. I plan on scheduling my surgery for right after I burn through all of my vacation.  Every. Last. Hour. And then I'm taking three weeks.
