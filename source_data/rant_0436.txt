Our lives are turned upside down when you get your period.

I don't know how much more I can take. 

I love you much. How can you be so close to me. Laugh, love, and experience life with me all month long and in matter of minutes (I've seen it with my own eyes) it's as if someone else takes over your body for 3 days straight! It freaks me the fuck right out. 

I want kids with you. We're both at a place in our lives that it's possible to financially, and emotionally support a child. Our child! 

But when you completely separate yourself from me when AF visits, it makes me feel like I've failed because you aren't pregnant. 

...You're older.  You've had abortions. You were given The Choice and you chose.  It's not my fault you don't have children today.  What am I supposed to do about that?  I'm fucking you at all the right times of the month, taking my vitamins, changing my diet. My Sperm analysis doesn't show model textbook numbers, but they were good enough to produce children from a prior relationship. 

It's not my fault! 

So quit making me feel like it is!
