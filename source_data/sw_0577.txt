No one to love...

I am a 14 year old in high school and I have had extreme ADHD. Now that it's settled down, I have extreme social anxiety. I'm sure what I'm saying now is just a waste of time because " people have killed themselves for better reasons " I've been told. My parents favorite my sister who constantly makes fun of me and tattles to my parents when I get mad. My dad calls me a dickhead for arguing with my little sister.

I often play computer games to get released of my stress. I joined a gaming community and have been their for a while. Now everyone is turning on me and idk why. I've never had a girlfriend and my best friend who is literally the "queen of all tumblr feminists" is now dressing like a hooker and is dating a High school Junior who sells medical marijuana illegally. I really want to die. My friendships are being destroyed and i have nobody
