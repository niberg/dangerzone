i just wanted to say this

ive been depressed on and off for the past two years but its been getting real bad recently. I have some social anxiety but I can normally put on a happy face and act fine. At one point i started cutting. I have been considering suicide for about the past month but i dont know if i have it in me to actually do it. of my close friends only one actually knows what is going on. shes the only person that keeps me going. she says i can talk to her about this kind of stuff but i dont know if its just me or something else whenever i see her in person its like shes different and when we are alone she seems to care about me. And sometimes when we talk i feel like im annoying her with my problems. she saw the cuts on my arm once and i just ignored her when she asked me about it at first. yesterday i thanked her for being there for me and basically told her she saved my life. she did. i just dont know anymore. The past couple days have been really rough. And for the other people i consider close friends they are never there. I just feel so alone. Part of me wants to die but part of me wants to keep on living
