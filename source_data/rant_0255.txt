Being a doctor who fan and having to deal with "Whovians"

  Alright, here we go. So I used to watch Doctor Who a lot, it was fun, loved it, overall good show. Then there's this one girl that references it and I'm like "ay lmao" and suddenly that whole fucking section of the school starts making Doc refrences to me and I'm all "Fuck this shit". SO i pretty much disown the whole show after it got infected.  Shit is fucking annoying as dicks in satan as he explains to you the vortex of sex in the city and glamour girl. And its not even just the fucking female fan base its the fucking dudes who wear fucking Fez's and Bow ties to school, like really. Are you fucking with my head. This shit is fucking annoying, no bow ties are not cool you fuckin ruined it mother fucker you ruined, i dont give one fucking fuck about your shit lord of a sonic screw driver ok.
