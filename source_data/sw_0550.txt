I'm such an idiot

I feel like such a loser.  I'm a nice person,  but I have really low self esteem. I don't feel like I'm interesting and I always feel like an idiot, like people don't like me and are just putting up with me. I have a few friends, but I dont feel like they like me as much as I like them. I don't feel like I even know how to make conversation.

I have a sister,  who I adore. I wish I was her. she has all the things I wish I had - confidence, friends, a husband and kids.. she lives in the same city as me, I see her every week or two. I like that, because I feel like she has to be my friend because she's my sister. 

she's invited our parents and me for dinner this weekend. this never happens unless it's an event like a birthday, and it's nobody's birthday.  I'm pretty sure she's going to tell us she's moving interstate. this thought hit me a 11 pm tonight, and even though it's not official I haven't stopped crying since I thought of it.  I'd be happy for her,  but I need her here to be my friend and the thought of her moving away has me distraught.

I feel like such a loser.  I'm 30, I shouldn't need to hang in my sisters shadow, but I do.  I'm afraid if she moves away I'll lose the tiny bond we have and I'll be even more alone.

I hate myself for being such a loser.   I'm so worked up I can't sleep. Its after 2 am now, I'm still crying,  I can't breathe through my nose,  I have a headache,  ive had to call in sick to work because im in no condition to go in. 

If she even is actually moving away i should be happy for her. I can't even do that right.
