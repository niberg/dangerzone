Unfertilized eggs are classified as children now?

So last night, my very Christian mom and I [17/f] were in the car on the way home from church, when she decided to put down my uncle for selling his sperm when he was in college. Then she jokingly told me not to sell my sperm in college, but then went on to explain that women can sell their eggs, but that as a "Christian" I shouldn't, because it is "against God." I was confused by this, because first of all, I'm pretty sure selling eggs does not require masturbation like selling sperm does, and it is helping another couple who is not fertile to have children. God told us to populate the earth, so how would selling eggs be against God? She hesitated, most likely searching for some type of answer to my question, then began to explain that an egg donor has no control over what happens to her eggs after she donates them, and if they "expire" and have to be "thrown out" it's "killing unborn children." 


Excuse me, but what? If unfertilized eggs are children, am I having a miscarriage every time I get my period? Am I killing children by not having sex so that my eggs can be fertilized?
