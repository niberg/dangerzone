I don't know why I am still alive.

I am neck deep in school work I said I would do but didn't and I think that this may be the end. I mean, I'm already ugly, fat, and not a "manly" man by the empirical standards of manhood thrust upon me by the media and my parents. Even though I'm told that I am smart, I don't think I would procrastinate so much if I was. I don't even feel like I have a future because I figure that I'll just wait until I can legally purchase a gun and do away with myself then. Neither the meds nor the therapy are much help. I am told that I am not doing my part by practicing what the therapist tells me, but then I feel like a piece of shit for not doing what I should be doing, pushing me further towards the precipice of death. The only real joy I get anymore is flogging the dolphin and listening to this rather "colorful" podcast. The only person that I really feel might miss me is this teacher of mine I had last year. It might be sad for him, but my death, like everything else will be transient. They will all forget me soon enough. I think I'm going to ready the rope now, things aren't looking up and judging by how things have gone, it is not likely to get better.
