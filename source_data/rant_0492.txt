Thank you for asking me if I'm gay.

I'm not being sarcastic. I'm really glad when someone asks, because it's happened enough for me to realize that EVERYONE I MEET THINKS I'M GAY. And the people who don't attempt to confirm their assumptions about me by asking a direct question base the rest of their interaction with me on false assumptions.

Most of the time, this isn't important at all. But it *is* important (to me) when the assumer is a woman I'm interested in. I mean, I'm not saying you would automatically be into me if I were straight. Christ, I'm not *that* narcissistic...

Look, I get it. I'm rather effeminate, awkward around women, don't use pick-up lines, don't try to find out if you're single as soon as I meet you, etc. I wasn't aware that any of this meant "I'm gay." Please don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with being homosexual. DUH. And I have certainly questioned my sexuality before.

The answer was I AM STRAIGHT.

Seriously, again, nothing wrong with being gay. It's just...if there's one thing that's almost as frustrating to me as intolerance of homosexuality, it's people making unfounded assumptions about other people's sexual orientation.

So please, I don't mind, really. Just ask. And maybe buy *me* a drink instead of waiting for me to prove I'm straight by making the first move.

Geez...I dunno, am I totally off base here?
