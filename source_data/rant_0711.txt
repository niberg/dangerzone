The fact that I get shit for listening to music that came out at the start of the year, because it's "old music."

My god. People who say I need "get with the times" music wise really piss me off. If I like a song, I'm probably not just going to ditch it after two weeks. I enjoy a very small variety of music, and am really not up to date with the new tunes. My friends sometimes give me shit for listening to music that "isn't cool any more" and "came out like, last year." Fuck off! If it's good music, then I'll listen to it, regardless of how long ago it came about, and I'm not going to continuously download and delete music from my selection because it's "old" or "new." Just stop, pls.
