We're going to go together

Me and my girlfriend have been in a very bad place recently.  The church we met at kicked her out and when I told them it was wrong they threatened to kick me out to. We can't go there for a safe place anymore. All we have left is each other and we've decided that going together is best for both of us. Any suggestions would be best before tonight.
