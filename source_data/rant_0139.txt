I know my prof is on sick leave, but...

Can we please get our results from our second exam back??  It's been 5 weeks!  We took our third exam on Friday, and still don't know how we did on the second one!  Our fucking MIDTERM GRADES were posted, but only included our first exam score... HOW IS ONE EXAM A FUCKING MIDTERM GRADE???

I know the prof is sick and out for surgery, so it's not like he's intentionally doing this.

But DAMN SON!  Give the fucking exams to a colleague to grade!  Not to mention the last section was taught by 5 different substitutes, none of which had seen the exam.  And 3/5ths of them SUCKED ASS at teaching.  This is not what I signed up for.  I want to know how I'm doing in the course.  I want to know how I did on the second exam.  FML
