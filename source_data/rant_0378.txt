Why the hell do people think it's okay to be mean to each other?

I just had a long time customer screw me out of $1,000 and he thinks its' completely okay. That $1,000 comes out of my pocket and I already spent it on shit that he now has in his possession. I call him and he acts all aggro like I did something wrong and that he deserves to keep it for absolutely no payment on his part.

I'm struggling to get by already and he knows it and he just wants to stick the knife in deeper and deeper. Why the fuck are psychotic people allowed to live in this world?
