Let's just start, I want to die.

I want to die.

I'm a miserable, crying sack of a human being. I've been this way as long as I can remember and can't see the feeling subside because I have an unchangeable pessimistic attitude about the world, I just simply find no point in it. I did at one point, but like anything else, I messed it up.

I am ugly, stupid, childish, pushy, and downright annoying to anyone I meet. I have no friends offline, and those online that once supported me no longer do, run from the abusive time bomb I am. I have one person to talk to online, and I fear I may just hurt her by dying, and almost wish she would leave so I can.

I find enjoyment in nothing, and just want to be free. If there is a hell, I belong in it, and sadly, that's that.
