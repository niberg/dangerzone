I wish my parents still hated me, I wish I had no friends.

It would make killing myself so much easier.

I was sexually abused at 14. Bullied all my life. Got into an abusive relationship at 16, just got out of it a few months ago. I've nearly failed this semester at uni due to battling a chronic incurable illness and court hearings against my abusive ex. I barely have any friends. I'm socially awkward, I have an eating disorder. I can't sleep at night. I'm always in chronic pain from my health.

I'm going to wind up crippled, in debt from a probably failed degree and alone. Every fucking night I cry myself to sleep and wish I had no one so I could just let go.
