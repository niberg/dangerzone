Back to feeling this way, again

This is a throwaway account, just a heads up.

I've been depressed for more than half my life, and while I'm not always suicidal, it never seems to take much to drive me to that feeling. Now? I'm a college student in the US. I'm not doing well with it. The first two years, I was on a scholarship, but now I've taken out over 25k in loans with my father as my cosigner. I can't face dropping out, but I'm doing so poorly academically and mentally that I don't know that I have much choice.

My boyfriend, my best friend, my cat, and my family are the only things keeping me here right now. But it seems harder everyday to hold on for them--and I just found out that the bank I took my loan from won't hold my cosigner responsible for paying if I die. Just feels like another reason to go.
