Cars!

Where did we get lost in what a fucking car is supposed to do.  
Its supposed to take all my shit and at least two people safely from point A to B.  
Just like how phones aren't just phones anymore.  
I get they are better in just about every way from the past BUT this should translate to how much cars currently weight and take to produce.  
A 1964 Chevy Impala weighed around 3500lbs... That is a full size muscle car...  
A 2015 mustang weight around 3800lbs... A small muscle car... WTF!!!
