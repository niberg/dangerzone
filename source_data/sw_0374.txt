Here's how I'm feeling

I'm lonely, Every girl I meet just friend zones me
I've been thrown out of home and lived on the streets a sum total of around 8 months altogether 
I have no job
no qualifications
no skills
I'm useless
I've always felt empty
My own mother told me I should kill myself
Why shouldn't I?
I'm not even 18 yet. 
I hate who I am
I have no confidence anymore
People I thought where friends treat me like scum ever since they found out I have Bi-polar
Give me a reason. a genuine reason other than "your life is just beginning" because as far as I'm concerned I've been living 17 years and 11 months, and I can't remember a time that i've actually wanted to live
