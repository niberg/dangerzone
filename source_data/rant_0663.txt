I will be the best father, I promise.

(This isn't exactly a rant you'd see here, but I just need to say this and here seems the best place)

Im going to be the best father ever. Just thinking about having a child makes me so damn emotional. I never got emotion from my father, other than anger. I will always tell my kids I love them. I will always tell them how proud I am. When they come home from school with a picture they drew of our family full of scribbles and unnatural colors, I'll hang it on my fridge with great pride. I'll play pretend with them. When they get too old for pretend, I'll teach them how to play football, or how to ride a bike, or how to swim. When they get too old for foam footballs, training wheels, and floties, I'll listen to all their middle school drama and understand pre-teens are a bit more touchy. I'll care, I'll understand, I'll be their best fucking friend. I'll be the reason they smile when they come home. Ill want to put band aids on their scratches. I'll stay up with them when they have the flu. I'll be the first to sign their cast after they break something. I'll watch their baseball games, their dance recitals, their band concerts. I'll be their number one fan. I'll help them improve every step of the way. I'll watch my boys become respectful men, and my little girls become graceful ladies. I will except my kids no matter what or who they choose to be. They will always be my children and I will guide them to the right direction. I will give them everything. They will learn manners, they will be respectful, and humble. Every single one of them will love their mother and show her respect. I just want to be a good father... That's my one goal in life... To give the love to my future children I didn't get. My father is a great man. I just wish we had a better relationship. I know he loves me, but I wish he'd understand me. I wish I could understand him. I'll be the best... I promise.
