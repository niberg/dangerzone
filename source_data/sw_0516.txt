I'm at the end of my ropes here.

I can't do this anymore. I'm so tired of living. I hate trying to combat my mental illnesses every single day trying to stay optimistic. I've been trying for so many years. 

I can't blame my family though. My whole life has been a series of failures and fucked up opportunities. I have costed my family a lot of money. 

I have no current friends and my family thinks I'm just a lazy bum mooching off of them. That's fine with me. I've been alone with my own thoughts for my entire life. 

I can't blame though. I'm not the best person and all I've done was screw up everything that I'm involved in.

I feel like I've lived a full life. I've drank to the point of alcohol poisoning. I've smoked until I passed out and I've let myself loose in mosh pits.

I've lived full lives through media. I've fought and conquered in video games. I've experienced heartbreaking stories in visual novels and anime. I've listened to the sound of utter desolation in black metal and I have had my imagination invoked through beautiful paintings. Some personal ones I have in ink under my skin. I have lived through art and media. Without it I'm sure I would have died years ago.

tbh I have no idea why I made this post. Some sort of validation? I'm not looking to be convinced otherwise. I've been down that path too many times only to be disappointed in the end. You're free to try though.
