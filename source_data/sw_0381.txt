I don't feel safe (not suicidal, but really bad intrusive thoughts, thought that this place is the best place to post)

I don't trust myself not to follow them. I don't want to, but they're overwhelming. 

I'm planning on going to the doctors tomorrow. Doing this will mean I will miss prac, and I effectively fail, which effectively, means I fail my course.

I suppose I'm just trying to seek support, I need reassurance this is the right thing to do. It'll break me to fail university, but I suppose that's better than doing something dangerous, right?
