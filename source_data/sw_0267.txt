can I just share my honest opinions about suicide?

it's just that there seems to be nobody open to actually listening to me and I wish I could talk to someone about it. every time I try to be honest about suicide people PANIC.

well, read on and you'l know why nobody who loves me could handle my being open about suicide. I told them I am suicidal and that was a hard enough pill to swallow, not gonna be able to talk more about it.

and therapists just freak out and ask me to talk to suicide hot line or other and no one truly cares or wants to listen because it's scary and I understand them and I know it's scary, but how do I get this off my chest then? so I came here:)

I like the idea of suicide. I often consider it. I have been considering suicide for at least a decade and a half. first time I remember considering suicide was when I was a little girl. I thought that if my life does not go as planned, I'd suicide at 45 and it will all be over and I won't have to suffer anymore.

that thought kept me going on so many occasions. the idea of suicide always gave me the feeling of security and control - like I had the power to get out of the *worst* situations. whatever happened to me, I could always end the pain.

so suicide has been a positive concept for me. and these days, when I suffer, I ask myself - so is this that bad situation when I hit the "get me outta here button" already or do I hang on for a little while more?

so that's my story. comes from childhood abuse, obviously. just wanted to share. thanks for reading. and much love, hope everyone here is doing the best they can
