Im Dieing In Exactly 20 Days From Now

In 20 days I turn 16. That will be the same day I die. I've never had a girlfriend and I don't have any friends outside of school. The only people that text me are my mom and dad. I've been used my entire life by other people. I discovered something that would solve all these problems and generally improve my life. But that thing is being denied to me and now I have no choice. I have borderline personality disorder and schizotypal disorder. I am incapable of feeling empathy for others. The only emotions I've felt in the last couple months have been anger, depression and sadness. I have absolutely no one to talk to about this and have been dealing with it for months now. I can't deal with it any longer and suicide is the only option left. Please convince me otherwise. 

No one who knows me would ever guess I would do this. I can't imagine how they would feel once they found out.
