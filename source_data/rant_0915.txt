Fuck you and fuck your goddamn bullshit. I'm done.

**NSFW LANGUAGE**

Pardon my vulgar language, but I'm pissed. Fuck my lazy-ass fucking dad and fuck my mom that took off before I was a week old. Fuck both of you.

I have to work two jobs just to keep our house from being evicted, and you have the fucking nerve to tell me to get better grades? You call *me* a lazy piece of shit?? Fuck you. You sit around the house, take the money that *I* earn, and spend it on cheap fucking beer. I'm the only one who does jack shit around the house. 

But screw him. *Screw him*. I'm done. I've been waiting for this day, and today was the tipping point. He just had to have his fucking lawn done at 9:00 PM at night. And then after the neighbors are done being pissed at me, you start yelling because I missed spots? Sorry I had nothing but my fucking phone flashlight to guide the way in front of me. Get used to mowing it yourself, because I'm out of here. I'm loading up my backpack with food, $4000, a cell charger, and a copy of The Hobbit and biking out of this god forsaken town away from your fucking shithole. I'd love to drive away, but your ass didn't drag me down to the DMV two hours away when I was 15 to get my permit. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. My 18th birthday is in six months. I hope I can make it that long. And if for any reason you dragged your carcass to the computer and see this, *kill yourself, you fat fuck*. You broke me. I'm done helping you.

As for the rest of you people on reddit, I'm really sorry. I had no friends to talk about this to. I also apologize for this horrible rambly, unformatted, overly-dramatic wall of text. This is a throwaway to protect my identity. You won't be seeing me again.
