Tests can go to hell.

Tests are the bane of American education. Too often are the high-stakes, too long, unnecessary, and so common that it makes me sick. I don't deny the usefulness of tests, but that's all they should be, *tests*. NOT these all-or-nothing-you-better-pass-to-succeed bullshit. NO WAY IN HELL does a test fully gauge the potential of a student. One can learn a lot and not have a test decide wether or not they did. I'm tired of tests and I'm tired of America's education system.
