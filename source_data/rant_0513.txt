suddenly vanished.

ever had a close friend you're very open with, and then suddenly one day she suddenly became cold to you and it's like she doesn't want to talk to you, and then when you talk to her, her aura's like "don't talk to me, I'm busy" or "yeah right, I don't care about all of what you said"
