Missed the Boat

Frankly, I am questioning the value of living. Is it worth the time? Should I bother to go on with life? I really can't imagine the prospect of happiness awaiting me anywhere in the future, nor the present, for reasons I have never been able to identify. For the past, I'll say, 5 to 7 years, I have been in a terrible rut. I have experienced primarily nothing but misery and melancholy.
Details? Honestly, what do they matter? I could probably come here claiming to be a former member of the SS who committed atrocities at Auschwitz, and still receive the all to predictable answers that would tell me that life is worth it, I deserve to be happy, it will get better, etc. The fact is, I don't understand why things are the way they are and I simply want them to be different. It boils down to the fact that I deem the life I have to be less than ideal, and so much so that I don't really think it's worth it a lot of time. Things don't seem fair and I seem to have been dealt a rather disagreeable hand - and I mean that literally. It sounds pretentious, but I don't want THIS life. It's not life. There are lives I would gladly take - and please don't give me that nonsense about problems in a pile and how I would be quick to snatch my own life back.
I don't really know what to say. Admittedly, the things that anger me are rather trivial and I am sometimes embarrassed to be brought down by them to this extent. Then again, I didn't ask to be born, and I'm the one who has to live my life anyway, so if I don't want to for whatever the reason at all, it should be my choice. At least from a philosophical viewpoint.
That's all.
