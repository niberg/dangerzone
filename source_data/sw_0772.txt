i woke up this morning

the first thing i did when i opened my eyes and realized i was awake was cry. 

i don't want to be alive. i have to pop xanax every few hours to make it to the next minute. i can't do this anymore. i just want him back. i have nothing. i want nothing else. heres to hoping my eyes dont open tomorrow.
