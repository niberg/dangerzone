Made him take the pistol

Because I don't trust myself. I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this sub, since it's "suicide watch" and I'm actively preventing myself, I guess.

I don't want to die. I don't want to feel like this. But a gun in the house feels too tempting. I have these intrusive thoughts about killing myself.

I have so much love in my life. My husband, my kids, my family. I love them all and yet all I feel is empty.

No one knows the extent, I guess until today when I told my husband to take the gun out of this house.

They still aren't aware of the depths I'm going to, to feel and to function. That I'm abusing xanax and hydrocodone just to function. Just to either feel warmth or feel nothing at all. Void.

My husband sees the cuts but he doesn't know what to say. He cleans the blood off me and sanitizes/bandages the wounds. He holds my hand and tells me we'll get me help and I'll be okay. 

I don't feel like I deserve him. I receive unconditional love from him and in return he gets a shell of a woman falling to pieces, pretending in every other aspect of life when I'm not opening wounds.

But how can I feel so empty and so sure of my love for people, of my love for life outside of this black cloud? 

Is it even possible to be the person he loved and redeem myself?
