I'm always filled with either extreme stress or loneliness

I really, really don't want to continue this way. I try to fill my life up with things to keep me busy, but no matter how busy I am, I'm still lonely.

I've been single for three years now, and it sucks. I'm a hopeless romantic, and it certainly seems like the hopeless part is true. I want little more from life than someone I care about who also cares about me, and being able to spend time with that person. This is likely the last semester I'll take on-campus courses at my college, and I haven't met anyone here. Because of this, I feel like my chances to meet someone are decreasing as time goes on.

The brief periods of time I'm not miserable from being alone, I'm pretty much always stressed out. Work is a stress I can handle that's starting to reduce with time. School scares me quite a bit. I'm terrible at math, and worried I'll fail this math class. This class is the only thing between me and graduation. I've gotten to the point in the class where I'm at a complete brick wall and feel like I understand nothing. With little more than a month to go, I really hope I'll pass, but it worries me a lot. I hate myself for not being able to understand it, especially since it's a fairly low level math course.

The way I see it, even if this stress completely vanished, loneliness would just take its place. And that scares me even more. Taking work and sleep out of the equation, I'll still have at least 5 hours a day to dwell on how alone I really am. And I don't know if that's something I'll be able to survive.
