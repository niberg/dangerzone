My husband told me to kill him first next time I try to kill myself. I'm freaking out because this seems like such a good idea in my head.

TLDR; fuck fuck fuck read the title. Fuck. 

He found me in the closet. I hide there when I'm anxious, and last week in there I tried to suffocate myself with a plastic bag. Today I was halfway eying a belt to do the job, but he wasn't asleep yet so he came to find me. I decided to try and talk with him. It didn't go well. 

Then he told me in all seriousness that if I die he wants to die too. He doesn't want to deal with the aftermath of my death. Well okay, that seemed sweet. Then he tells me to do it when he's asleep... I ask what he means. 

He wants me to shoot him and then shoot myself. He's been thinking this over the last 2 weeks. He has it all planned out. Right before he tells me these things I watch him load his gun. 

I thought about it and quickly started fantasizing about dying that way. I freaked out. I don't want to kill my husband! But I'm so desperate to die I was considering it. I got his handcuffs, he came to see what I was doing and I sobbed and begged him to cuff me so I wouldn't hurt him. He cuffed me. Maybe 15 min later I asked him to take them off and he did. I went to put them away and saw his gun with the lock on it. (If he would have told me he could lock it I wouldn't have needed cuffed, geez.)

This whole story reads so pathetic. I'm incapable of making any of my own decisions right now. I'm bipolar 2 and rapidly cycling these last few weeks. I want is to die, my husband is the only thing worth living for and now he's put an even larger burden on me.

I'm assuming he was trying to scare me straight or some shit because he did lock his gun up after I freaked out. It was really unfair, I'm so sick already and nudging me towards hurting him along with myself was just plain mean.

Meds have kicked in, I'm much calmer now.
