Ugh.

Ughhh. Today was just a generally bad day. I didn't total my car or anything. Nothing too terrible. Just a shitty day in general. School was uneventful. I got home. My 72 million dollar ship was blown up in EVE (I'm pretty poor), and I keep stubbing my toe on things. To add on that, I have a strange infection that hurts like all hell broke loose when I so much as tap it, so that's even worse. To top everything off, I got my ass handed to me in an FPS and realized that most of the things I do that I find amusing are not nearly as funny to everyone else. And I'm tired. So, so tired. But I don't want to sleep yet.

Sorry guys.
