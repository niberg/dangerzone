My God, people are fucking RETARDED!

[HATRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrX7G-1xPLs), a new game that was just revealed recently. The trailer speaks for itself about how unbelievably over-edgy, emo, and brooding it is. But it's obvious that it was made that way deliberately.

But even despite this, people are **ALREADY** whining and complaining over NOTHING yet again about Video Games inciting Real-Life Violence.

We have been down this road so many times, and you'd think people would fucking learn by now, right?! BUT NO! Of course not! Cuz people are fucking retarded, as always.

May I remind you guys *yet again* that this is a fucking **VIDEO GAME**? Killing people in Video Games **Does Not Incite** Killing People IRL. Even in games like this, it *still* doesn't incite that at all.

Never Has. Never Will. **END OF FUCKING STORY**!

While yes, this game is Extremely Mean-Spirited and Overly-Edgey for the sake of Being Overly-Edgey, that doesn't mean it "Crossed The Line" or anything like that *whatsoever*.

There are *plenty of games* before this one where you can literally do **The Exact Same Fucking Thing** with Killing Civilians on a Violent Postal Rampage.

What games do we got here....

- Saints Row
- Grand Theft Auto
- Postal
- Manhunt
- Watch_Dogs
- Grezzo 2: Una Magica Avventura
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
- JFK: Reloaded

Need I go on? &gt;_&gt;

And yet even despite these games, this one in particular just so happens to suddenly get peoples attention?

My God, you people are fucking retarded.

Does that means I'm gonna play this game? Admittedly, probably not. Me personally, I feel like this game was kinda trying too hard and did most of the things it did just for Shock Value, so it isn't really my cup of tea per se.

But the point is, people are just throwing useless and senseless temper-tantrums over **NOTHING** yet again.ï»¿
