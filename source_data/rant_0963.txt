Your kid doesn't have mental issues, you're just a shitty parent.

When I first started working with you, I thought you were interesting. I admired that whole "single working mother with deadbeat baby daddy who's nowhere to be found" thing. I like that you took the initiative to work for a living.  What I don't like, is hearing you talk like you know better than any child psychologist on the planet and how you've diagnosed your kid with all forms of autism and mental disabilities because he doesn't listen to you.  Here's the deal, friend. He doesn't listen to you because you don't discipline him. Yes, I was there when you were talking to your dumb hick friend about how the child psychiatrist told you that when your shitty kid wasn't  staying in the corner for a timeout, you were supposed to hold onto him and sit there with him, to show that you were in control and that he had to listen.  But no, you and your buddy said that that is abuse and it's so bad to do that to kids and you just sounded so damn smug.  The only reason I keep you around on Facebook is for work emergencies and all I see is you complaining about how everything sucks because you had a kid and about how no doctor knows how to "treat" your son.  Perhaps if you stopped chasing anything with a dick and a pickup truck that will stand still long enough for you and paid attention to your kid instead of dumping him on your sister and parents, he'd stop being obnoxious.  Seriously, he doesn't know his ABC's but when he hits his head at the park and the doctor asks him he suddenly does? Your kid is playing you, but you're too busy leaning on him as a "oh my kid isn't right in the head his dad isn't around woe is me" crutch to notice.  Oh, and great idea getting back together with his deadbeat abusive dad whose behavior you made a point to tell us about to demonstrate how horrible he is.  Nobody feels bad for you.
