Enough of talking about that whore of a woman, named Kim Kardashion! Why the fuck do people care about what she does!

Lets be honest, there are so many more woman that have done far greater, contribute far more, than this cancer of a woman, that seems to spread online faster than Ebola in Africa. Woman, who actually contribute to life, whether it's charity, or some sort of contribution in some way, are getting so little acknowledgement (if any), because we only seem to talk about Kim . She filmed her self sucking some cock and getting rammed up the ass, now she is "talk of town" every 3 minutes. Either through news reporting, magazines, tv, social media or general chit-chat. It doesn't help that, her husband is a complete utter flog, that has more arrogance than a professional boxer, that gets offended the second we are not praising his "god like" talent. I'm aware that, in a way that I'm contradicting my self, by also giving attention to these oxygen thiefs, but had to let it out
End of rant, and hopefully of that cunt of a woman. (and husband).
