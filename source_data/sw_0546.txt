I'm suicidal and was denied the help I need

I've been suicidal on and off for 15 years. I'm 28 and my 8 year relationship is in complete chaos. I have severe depression, binge eating disorder and I'm codependent towards my alcoholic fiance. Im in actual physical pain from my depression. Over the last 4 months, I've gone through one disaster after the other and I fear the end of my life is near. I don't want to be suicidal, but because of all the stress I'm under and a women who has been stalking, harassing me and telling me to kill my self everyday, I am. My mind goes there every time I am the least bit sad, uncomfortable or inconvenienced. 

I tried to get into the Focus Program for depression at Rogers Memorial Hospital in Wisconsin, but my insurance does not cover residential care for depression. If I had a drug or alcohol addiction, I would be covered. The cost of treatment would be between $45,000 and $60,000. Why is it that the only options for me are take these pills and cheer up? I need longterm residential treatment. I need to learn how to be an adult. I don't want to die at the moment, but at some point today I will and I'll weigh the pros and cons and imagine what will happen once I'm gone. 

I've reached out to Dr.Phil and The Doctors TV show for help. I want to start some kind of scholarship for people like me who need residential treatment. I NEED help. I have no idea what to do. I've begged for help.
