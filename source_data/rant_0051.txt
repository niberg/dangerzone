Anonymity and freedom

I am sick and tiered of the general public and for that matter Reddit, which is just the internet general public...  
Us humans have WAY to much freedom and anonymity on a day to day basis which has cheapened every other facet of our existence.  
  
Be responsible for yourself and your actions.
