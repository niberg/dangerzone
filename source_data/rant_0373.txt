Why the fuck do I have to fill out so many official documents to student teach?

I am currently filling out my application to student teach and goddamn is it pissing me off. First of all, our professor expects us to reformat her shitty microsoft word formatting. Second of all, why do I have to look up all the classes I've taken or will take and look up observation hours. I haven't taken some of these classes in 2 years, how will I remember what my co-op teacher said about me?? Also, I have to fill out how many hours I will have to observe for future classes, which requires me emailing 10 professors just to ask a simple shitty question.

I can understand filling out the total hours we're observing for, and our personal philosophy because this is something that a principal or superintendent will , but why would they give a flying fuck about my courses, my high school activities, or references? If they really cared about courses, I could just email them a list! But no, my stupid college is making me fill out this weird excel sheet with a bunch of useless info on it. This isn't a job application, so idk why I need to fill out volunteering and references, because student teaching is a required course. I don't want to get too personal to remain anonymous, but right now I really am angry. At this point, student teaching would be a relief.
