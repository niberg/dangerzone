Speedos in America

I don't understand why people are so hyper sensitive to showing skin in America. The other day I was at swim practice and I had to get something out of my car, so I went out in my speedo because I didn't want to waste time getting dressed. When I was outside I heard women wooping and people gave me nasty looks. Some kid even approached me and said I looked gay. That's the thing that pisses me off the most. What about wearing a speedo makes me look like I am attracted to men? I just don't understand people sometimes
