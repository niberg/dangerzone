I've given up on getting help.

Two months ago I was nearly cured, ready to come off my meds. Something happened and I nearly killed myself for the first time. I immediately started taking risperidone and two weeks later I seemed cured. I'm not. People at school have no idea of how depressed I am, and I don't even know how I've managed to seem so alive while feeling dead.

I was almost feeling well again. Today, my mum stormed into my room and started screaming at how arrogant I am because I think her advice is shit. Truth is, all she told me is stuff I've done. That I should stop worrying. Now, she says I should stop being a little bitch and stop being depressed. As soon as she left, I rushed to the kitchen and asked my brother's nanny for my clonazepan. I yelled at her and told her that either she got three of them or I'd finish it there and then. She took a while to start moving and I opened the drawer and got my knife. She hit my hand and held me. Had she not been there I would be dead. I'm not sure anymore if that is a good thing. I give up on getting help. This is my last resort. I have no reason to be depressed, NO REASON, I'm smart, handsome, nice, even rich, but I am, and I hate myself for it.
