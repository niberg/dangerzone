You're all a bunch of fucking lairs.

Why even pretend?

None of you care. None of you even remotely care. The only reason you browse this sub is because of some obligation to make us feel better with your wishy-washy feel good bullshit and non answers. I mean look. 32k readers and each post here gets like, maybe 3 comments? Do you guys just browse this subreddit, passing up threads left and right and think "Naaaaaah, they got this. They'll figure it out."

I mean, I get it. I don't like it, but I get it. What do you say to someone who wants to drive off a bridge and hope that it kills them? What do you say to someone with very little reasons to live? I get that you may not want me to kill myself, but at least don't lie about wanting to help anybody. I'm just another faceless name on a huge website with millions of users. Just stop lying and admit it. Here, we'll say it together. 

"I don't really care!"

There, was that so hard? I'm so sick of all the lies people throw at me. No one cares. I will never feel loved. I will never feel like I belong. No one feels the way I do, right now, in this moment. Medication does not work. Situations won't change. Things won't just magically get better. Therapy does not help. Talking does fuck all except show someone how vulnerable you are and watch them judge you and all your flaws while simultaneously being so unbelievably fucking *pandering*. And most of all, you don't care if I die. I value honesty, I really do, so just own up and admit it.

You don't care, you never have cared, you never will care. You think that posting a few sentences to a thread will miraculously help someone who genuinely wants to die. Someone wants to drive off this big bridge called life and into the depths of hell below, and all you mother fuckers do is upvote and downvote.

YOU'RE ALL LIARS!!!

I think i'll go for a drive now. Jury's still out on whether I'm coming back.
