Teaching in an urban school

I am teacher at a public school in Brooklyn. I am disgusted by the system and the lack of support from our local administration all the way up to the DOE. We are not even given paper to print on! we have to purchase all of our supplies. The printing machine has been broken for weeks and there is no fax machine!!! In addition there is only 1 computer lab of maybe 30 computers ( the school has over 800 students) and access in technology available to  students is scarce. The paint is peeling off the walls and there is NO ac in the summer months! This is a disgrace that in a country that stands up for equality, the poor youth of America is getting a half ass education and are expected to compete with the rest of the world.
The school is a low performing school and there is always an air of failure and disappointment floating around. Nevertheless, I have to say I love the students I teach. Their resilience and good demeanor in such an environment is remarkable. They are the only redeeming quality of the place.
