No internet! That is not an opinion!

Am I the only that has noticed that any time anyone says anything remotely controversial and unsubstantiated, they say "Well, it's my opinion man" or something along those lines as to shrug responsibility for being wrong. First, opinions can be wrong, let's go ahead and get that out of the way. If you have an opinion formed due to fallacies, that opinion is wrong.
Secondarily, you don't get to have opinions about empirical questions. You don't get an opinion as to what color the damn grass is just like you don't get an opinion as to whether or not someone did X or Y.
I've experienced countless internet arguments that end in "Well that's just my/your/whomever's opinion." Some things are opinionated, doesn't mean there's no discussion to be had, that would be stupid. We all have opinions about things like abortion and equal rights (and so on), that doesn't mean we're all right and we all get to be special little flowers.
But most importantly, the thing to take away from my rambling, you do NOT get opinions on facts.
