I don't know how to get out of this

I'm 17 and just got expelled from school. A friend was smoking weed in class and handed me the bowl but I quickly handed it back because I didn't want a part of it, he got caught and when classmates wrote their statements about what they saw they said they saw me with the bowl. Now I'm looking at a felony charge for "possession" and my parents don't believe that I wasn't smoking too. They told me ive ruined their lives. Now I cant see my boyfriend at school or talk to him and hes the only person I have left. I already have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and things are really hard on me. Usually things I get into aren't this serious but this is going to affect my entire life if I keep living. My mom said I'm killing her and my dad and I feel like I need to die. I don't know how to get away other than to finally do it.
