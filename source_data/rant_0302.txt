Eff You, downvoting a 1 vote to a zero.

I agree with the Reddit philosophy that, if you don't like something, down vote it. But then again, when something is sitting there, languidly hanging out at a 1, new and you see it and think, "Well fuck this. I'll play judge and jury and make sure nobody will ever see it," then, well, you can go suck on a bag of dicks. 

I uploaded a basketball game to /r/Fresno. A game that only people in Fresno would care about - beating Jerry Tarkanian's Running Rebels. Took me 4 hours to do it. I shared it on the goddamn Fresno subreddit so that all five people who go there can see it, or ignore it. Except that some asshole decided, "Nope! I won't allow that. I saw this first and zero it will be! Down with you, you bundle of sticks!"  

That shit is unnerving and, more importantly, ego-maniacal. Leave it alone. It can languish at a 1 vote. I don't give a fuck about a 1. 

The irony is that some asshole will downvote this to a zero because, well, this website is filled with little children with bad attitudes.
