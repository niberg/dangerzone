Tonight, I'm gone

They say that those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it. Now, I've been in history's school of hard knocks, and if there's one thing I can say with certainty, it's that it was doomed to repeat itself anyway. As you may or may not know, I am Karl, Karl Burniston. My life so far has been a collection of lucky breaks and free passes. I receive constant support and reinforcement for my numerous issues, most of which are minor and frivolous. You could and probably do say that my complaints are merit-less, and for the most part, you would be right. I live in an upper middle class family with infinite resources and support. I have no right to be complaining. Regardless, this is not what I am here to talk about. Every emotion that I have felt, every goal I have set out to achieve, and every conversation that has shaped me is for naught. Oh, of course you could say that I was striving for a better future, but that's not the case. I was striving for a life worth living, and I'm afraid to say that this is a goal that will not be reached. Countless days and nights I've toiled, battling depression and the like. And an equivalent number of times I have been stopped or saved by someone. This cycle ends now. I don't need to be stopped or saved, because the one thing I need the most is silence. I hope you can understand. Farewell, and to all I have ever loved, the people I've met, the lives I've impacted, the goals I've achieved, the things I have done, and the things that would but never will be, **I'm sorry.**
