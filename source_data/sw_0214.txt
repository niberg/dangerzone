Waiting

In my city, there's this really nice river that runs through it so I figured it'd be a nice andpical place to do. I'm here with a bottle and a knife. There's this fucking voice that refuses to go away. It keeps flashing mental images of me stabbing myself and I swear to God I almost feel it sometimes. I don't want to go on living with that niggling voice saying my name and telling me that I'm dead or will be. I can't call anyone because I can't tell them this kind of stuff. At least 's a nice night.
