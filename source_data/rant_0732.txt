EA is the Worst.

EA has to have the worst customer service and servers I've ever dealth with. I'm trying to buy a game on origin for the first time but my attempts have been dwarfed by EA's shitty system. First my debit payment could not go through and I was forced to wait a more than a week for that news. Then I buy Game cash, deposit them in my account, and then learn that I cant buy the game because my account is supsended?!?!?!? Are you serious?! If my account was suspended why was I allowed to deposit points in the first place. Now I have to wait another week just to maybe hear news and possibly get the game I've already waited more than a week to play. FFS man this is ridiculous.
