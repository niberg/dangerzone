I hate applying for jobs from corporate franchises

I am sick of wasting 20 minutes of my time on one application that makes me fill out EVERYTHING ON MY RESUME AND THEN ATTACH MY GOD DAMN RESUME! Why doesn't someone just read it? And the essays they make you write about 'why do you want to work for us?' well, I need a job to live, you guys had positions open! You're not special! I need some work! Making me write paragraphs of bullshit about why I want to work at your store and what I could bring to the store and blah blah blah is a waste of everyone's time, because it is nothing but the same bullshit coming out of everyone's mouths. Do they seriously read that crap and think, well, gosh, this person sure is genuine! Really they're just hiring the biggest bullshitter. And then, of course, you spend half an hour writing crap and submitting it, and they never even respond to your peasant ass because why bother? We're just gonna have some program figure out keywords and hire you off that, because obviously a robot will hire the best people. And god damn, lady who called me other night and didn't say where she was from and what position it was before she started asking why I wanted to work there, why do you get offended when I have to ask which job you are talking about and where? I am sorry your store isn't the most fabulous store ever and Oh I will only apply here out of all the places that are offering jobs because it is so special! Fuck you
