21 y/o m at a crossroads

I haven't thought about this since I was 16, but for the first time since I thought about committing suicide. I want to call it. Unfortunately, I think I would be letting down my family and friends. It is the only thing that stops me. With school, work, and a lack of free time I don't have anything to grant me happiness. The one person who did was my girlfriend, but we've been broken up for months yet she still appears in my dreams leaving me sleepless. I've picked up World of Warcraft to help distract myself but at the end of the day I miss having somebody to talk to, somebody to hold, and somebody to share something with. Some people say "make some friends" but I am absolutely terrible at it. Some people say "find a hobby", but I don't have the time or patience to do so. I feel lonely, drained, and useless. I pretend to be jovial to the public, but inside I feel crippled. I'm tall but feel like I'm 3 feet tall. I've been told I'm good looking, but I feel hideous. I just want somebody to calm me down and help lose my mania. I don't know what to do reddit.
