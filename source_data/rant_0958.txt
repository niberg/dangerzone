I'm going to win big in the lottery in a few days.

Once I win I'll finally be able to hire a private chef that cook all my muscle meals, and rolls my blunts for me when if I don't feel like it. Secondly I'm going to just workout everyday and get more ripped to where I'm reppin two plates . Thirdly I can't wait to be able to do whatever the fuck I want which would consist of eating perfectly healthy meals , working out every day , and just you know ballin out low key no flex zone .
