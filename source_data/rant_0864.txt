Let the bride and groom have their moment!

We get it, you're fucking drunk, but this is a WEDDING!! Everyone here doesn't want to hear your drunk rambling and shouting while the best man is giving his speech.

And when someone tells you to calm the fuck down, you respond with "I'm just having a bit of fun." FUCK YOU! Show some fucking respect, for crying out loud.
