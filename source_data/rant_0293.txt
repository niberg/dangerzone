All the 'cheater' and 'cheating' blaming on /r/relationships ignores that most people cheat..

I swear that sub-reddit ( and /r/relationship_advice ) hate cheating with a FIERY PASSION of 1000 scorned nerd boys.

Do they not look around in the world? Cheating is everywhere and everyone cheats. They always urge people to report cheaters among their close friends circle. This would lose you most of your friends where I live..

They are trying to act the moral police as Islam or Christian preachers before them.
