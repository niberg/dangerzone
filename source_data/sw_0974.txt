I don't know what I want from life anymore

I'm 17 about to turn 18 and I have no see able future. I left school at the beginning of my final year due to not feeling up to doing work so I left before I got kicked out. Everyone I know has a career they'd like to follow but I have nothing I want to do, no huge interests, no goals, no life and it doesn't help my girlfriend of 2 and a half year's broke up with me three months because of a guy she liked for for a year and possible cheating but I still can't get over her. I had nothing going for me besides her. She was my life and I still miss her and can't get over her even now. I try to go out to see friends and new people but I end up feeling anxious and sick so I end up going away. I've started drinking and smoking to make things more bearable (the legal age for me is 18). I want to go out to meet new people and start a career but I end up getting lazy and nervous about it plus having no money doesn't help. being at home all day with just my thoughts its killing me. The thoughts of my ex and my future is driving me crazy, to the point I want to kill myself. In the last five years I've tried to kill myself three times, two of them being this year. I can't do it though, I just cant even though my thoughts are torture. There's only one person I like talking to but I feel like most of the time she doesn't want to talk. I also have a crush on her but she has no interests in me like that (im pretty sure) but that's the one thing I'm fine with. I'm sorry if this seems all over the place but I just don't know any more. I don't know what career I want, if I want a relationship, if I should kill myself. I don't know
