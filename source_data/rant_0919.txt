The greatest shitting on of all time

You guy might remember me from last week, I was ranting about people calling me low for asking a girl out to homecoming. Turns out that my defense of her came around and **bit me in the ass**.  

Cut to yesterday, I receive a text from my date (who I will henceforth call Miranda). She tells me that she needs to let me know something. All you guys out there know that this isn't a good thing. So I'm up all night worrying about this. 

Today comes and we meet before school to talk. Wanna know what she says? She was walking to her car on Monday when one of her guy friends kissed her. And she now realized that she has feelings for him. I'm obviously pissed by this point. All I say is that I don't know what to say. She says that she still has feeling for me too and needs to make a decision about who she wants a relationship with. 

This has me pissed the fuck off. We were in a relationship and she kisses one of her friends? This is enough to piss any guy off, but she takes it farther. Now she decides she needs to *make a decision* about who she wants to be in a relationship with? So now I'm seen as an option. Later she was texting me and said that it was a hard decision because she knew that "either way she was going to hurt someone". She's already hurt me just by doing this. God dammit. I'm so pissed. I defended her against hordes of people calling her a "whore" or a "slut" and this is how I get repaid. Every person I've told says it's a dick move on her part. Motherfucking fuck. Thanks for listening folks.

Edit: apparently she's making the decision tonight.
