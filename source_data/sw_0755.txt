My Back Has Broken

My father was a schizophrenic and died when I was young
My step-father is an alcoholic
My mother is unhappy and stuck
My closet relationship was with a girl who I still think about 5 yrs ago
My sister is a drug addict 
My younger brothers are my hope
I was molested when I was a teen by a friend 
My life has no general direction besides to make something of myself that I'm not sure I want to be
I toil all day and night with full time work and school. 

I am Atlas with the weight of world has broken my back
