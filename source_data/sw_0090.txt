Graduate Course Gone

I'm so close to killing myself, I just can't stand it. My GPA was fine and then I failed one fucking subject, I don't see the point in repeating the fucking subject since my GPA is in tatters now because of the fail. I was so fucking close to getting into my dream course as well.
