Why continue in this purgatory....the futility is too burdensome....

Let me start off by saying that I do not intend to encourage suicide nor do I see it as a 'better' choice.This is more of an existential post asking that why should I,as an individual ,continue? (Apologies in advance for the length)

Being of a scientific mind and a MD,I fully appreciate the sheer audacity of life to exist defiantly in the face of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and an unforgivingly entropic universe.
The fact is that I exist in that exact eye-blink in the space-time continuum where we as a human species,have been around for less than 250 thousand years in a universe that is 13.8 Billion years old.Thats literally less than a second if its all scaled down to 24 hours.

At my time in the hospital, I have witnessed patients recover against all odds and logic.Observed really random biological phenomena that is laughably ignored by the medical community simply because we do not understand it.
When you are constantly hammered by the limitations of your own human mind and the restrictions of the shared human sensory experience it starts to wear you down.We might be the most dominant species in terms of intelligence but the fact is in terms of sheer biological attributes,there is every kind of species superior to us in some way that exists in nature.
Scientists and philosophers agree to some degree on the point, that we will never figure out what is going on in the grander scheme of things either.Eg:Dark matter is estimated to constitute 84.5% of the total matter in the universe,while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95.1% of the total content of the universe.This is matter quantum astrophysicists have tried to decipher but have no HUMAN way of observing let alone begin to understand.

Even in terms of our time on Earth,the Sun is reaching its mid-life anyway.Barring the really low probability of space travel through worm-holes we are going down.Scientists lean towards the belief that we as a species we will be extinct long before even that happens ,just like the dinos before us(who lived 800 times longer than we have so far).And even in this short period of time we have been far more destructive to each other and to the habitable ecosystem of the planet than any species ever.We even managed to puncture the ozone layer FFS.
Anthropologists and sociologists attribute this and all our other achievements to the shared evolutionary drive for gene dominance in tribalist patterns just like most other primate species.The whole concept of nations/empires and civilization in general revolves around this genetic pinball.So in effect all our achievements,our social expressions of love/hate,its all just the same thing.

The point I'm making is that in the grand scheme,my existence has been no more fruitful than some virus biding its time at the bottom of the Pacific.Sure I saved a life now and then,made a few people happy,and did some fun things,but for what??There was always some personal gain involved,in the form of money,feeling good etc.

My own story has been one of constant struggle and surviving against the odds.My family consisted of an emotionally distant and cold mother in an unhappy marriage to my even more stupid father.I was sexually abused by a babysitter multiple times as a child,constantly bullied in schools because of my quiet nature( omega male behaviour,if you want to be a prick),grew up with a sister who became socially withdrawn and distant after a rape attempt in high school.All of this surrounded in a retardedly religious and conservative community,which I somehow managed to survive by making the mistake of getting myself into rigorous grind of med school.I guess science was an escape.

The sacrifice of social life was something I subconciously felt that I deserved stemming from the psychosexual guilt of that abuse,followed by the loss of the only home town friend I had in an accident,while I was away at college.
The strain any sexual relationship,with college girlfriends,placed on me was always too great because of the emotional havoc it causes inside me.The reality is that in my head,I am beyond repair.Studies conducted on child sexual abuse survivors,(I was 7-8 y.o),WORLDWIDE consistently point to the same pattern--low self esteem/worth---&gt;social retardation---&gt;intellectual over-compensation(am still pursuing a PhD) OR escapist behavior as a defense(eg: addictions)--&gt;further social isolation due to criminal behavior(in low impulse control individuals)or pursuits to endlessly rationalize(in highly self controlling individuals like me).This has been attributed to the chemical imbalance that gets primed for negative reinforcement loops in the developing brain of kids which are really like sponges.The Limbic system,amygdala...all sorts of mechanisms and learning behaviours get fcuked up.

According to the latest studies,CSA Survivors are six times more likely to kill themselves in comparison to the mildly depressed.Add to that doctors have a 3 times higher suicide rate than other professions(lawyers come close).Maybe because those careers attract those sort of constantly pushed/escapist minds.(and type A personalities)

I already know the pharmacologically destructive nature of the drug treatments and the monstrous nature of Big Pharma.Tried therapy,found it superficial and wasteful.Tried all types of rec drugs in college,but apart from some interesting time with psilocybins,I haven't had any epiphanies or any real interest in getting high or drunk.Helped in a soup kitchen,worked with homeless people,gave money to charity,learned to play the piano,trekked,gymmed...apart from superficial relief,nothing really helps.
I know I'm too damaged to adopt a kid and as a single parent or even as a married one,would invariably fcuk his/her life up as well.Knowing its all futile in the grand scheme of things(see above) makes it all the more cumbersome.
Reached my 31st birthday last week,and lets get real,my brain is slowing down.I'm not smart enough to cure cancer or prove String Theory.Even if I do,whats the point?? Heck even the PhD seems insurmountable at this point.My body has already begun its inevitable decline as the free radicals accumulate and entropy does the rest.
If there is a higher super-concious entity that exists,it wouldn't care for what goes on or happens to evolved life at this particular point in the space-time continuum on a meaningless rock we call Earth.
The only real link I had to any sort of a past: a grand-uncle, passed away a little over a year ago with a broken mind and body.I'm looking to end all this and sleep peacefully forever sometime before the year ends(few things to sort out first),before it starts getting ugly for me too.Its my final escape from this purgatorial existence called life.

The sole reason I am posting here is to get a different perspective if there is one.(Again sorry for the length and no TL;DR)
