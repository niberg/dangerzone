Please help one of my best friends is considering killing himself and I have no idea what to do. I've tried talking to him but it sounds like he's made his decision, I don't know how to help him or who to ask for help. Please help in anyway and upvote for visibility.

He's been going through extremely rough times the past year. Failing out of SDU, having to move in with his sister and her girlfriend. I can't really type more because my thoughts are completely scrambled from worrying. Please help with any advice you can give me. I don't know what else to do, who else to ask. I got this news today. And I'm pretty sure he's decided he's going to do it. Does the fact that he told me prior to the fact mean anything?
