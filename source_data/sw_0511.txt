I am just so numb

I don't really have any real world friends. Like, at all. And I've grown apart from my internet friends lately. I still talk to a couple of them but anymore I just feel like I'm a burden, so talking to them about this kind of stuff is hard. 

I'll try not to post a long-winded diatribe about how crappy my life is here, but unfortunately I can't promise anything. I am a 28-year old transgender woman. I am nearing 400 lbs at 6'1". 

All my life, for as long as I can remember, I've suffered from severe depression. I'm so depressed that I hardly have the energy to peel myself off the couch anymore. Tension over my transition has driven my family away to the point where we don't even speak anymore. I self-medicate with food, which, coupled with my lack of energy is what's responsible for my weight. Sometimes my binges are followed by purging.

Because of a number of assaults and a rape I am terrified to go outside. I've stepped out of this apartment probably less than ten times in the last 3 months. I'm also so self-conscious/horrified by my weight that the very thought of going out and talking to people is enough to send me into tears.

I don't even think of my future anymore. I used to dream about a lot of things...losing weight, fixing my life, going to college, making friends, finishing my transition. But now, I've pretty well given up on all of it.

I think pretty soon here I'm going to see about buying a shotgun.
