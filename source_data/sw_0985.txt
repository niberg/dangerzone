I just tried to hang myself, but the belt broke. Wanna talk?

Haha. So yeah. Title says it all. What's up guys? I've had suicidal thought since I was 16 when my dad died. I used to cut, but not so much anymore. Usually it's this overwhelming feeling of loneliness that sweeps over me. I talked about it with my counselor and he made a direct connection now to when my dad died. A bit of backstory. I just moved to Chicago from Southern California and I have nobody in my life right now who cares. I have a long distance girlfriend technically, but she's decided we are doing the open thing because she is too worried that I'll cheat on her. I find out today that she has been sleeping with other guys and making out with them. What do I expect? That's what open means after all. Anyways then the hanging, belt thing. So yeah. What's up?
