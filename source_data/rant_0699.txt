APPLE JUST FUCKED UP MY COMPUTER.

So i just upgraded to the new OSX Yosemitie os, and theres a FUCKING cracking noise in my audio and the performance now SUCKS ASS! This computer was the fastest thing ive owned for a while but now its worse than a 200 dollar notebook! This absoluteley sucks now that my audio and video software isnt going to work well. I hope apple fixes this but this is probably the last time im upgrading my os.
