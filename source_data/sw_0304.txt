My full story

I just wanted to put my story out there and see how other people would see it. I am currently age 17, moved to the US 5 years ago and it is hell, I met a few friends however none of them shall I call them my true friends as you will see, I will introduce each individually. First is a girl I met the first year I moved here and she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life, we talked and became friends and then I fell in love with her, being my super shy self, I never told her how I feel to this day because I know how it would turn out, she has no clue about this and has been dating other guys so I know she doesn't like me at all. I have done so much for her, at times when she had lunch detention, I would always skip my own lunch so I could get her some food, I always tried to help her in anyway I can. Next are my two good friends I met last year, they are okay friends and good people but the thing is, I was the first among st my friends to get my license so we used to hang out alot then, now that they all have cars of their own they never seem to wanna talk or hang out. Alot of people have bad parents or something but that is not the case with me, sure they can have their mad days but they are great people, a few weeks ago I got my acceptance letter from a college and my parents having some kind of pride must send me there even though they know we don't have money. My loneliness is very high, I haven't even touched the hand of a person of the opposite sex with any meaning. I feel as though leaving this place would be the best for me, it would solve all my problems. I fucking hate this world anyways.
