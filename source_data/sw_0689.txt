Boyfriend found a child who had committed suicide. How do I help him?

My boyfriend ('A') who is not in the came city as me, works with children. Tonight he found one of the boys after he had committed suicide. 'A' seems to be holding up ok at the moment, but I know that won't last for long. I can't physically be with him. How do I help? What are the right things to say in this situation? I don't know what to do.
