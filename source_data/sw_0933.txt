I hate feeling like so much pain. I wrote this just now while going through a breakdown

I don’t want to live this way. I’m dying inside every minute. The thought of suicide passes through my mind every time I see a knife, bottle of pills, a car passing by or anything else of that sort. The relief that comes with these thoughts is breath taking. Just the fact of being free is enough to make me feel euphoric… if that makes sense. I’d do anything to feel loved or safe but nothing I try works. I’m a failure in every sense. I sit and play video games all day, that’s what I do with my life. People are too scary to even talk to. They send shivers down my spine because I know they don’t care. They never will. I’m the loveless and will always be just that. I screw everything up. It’s not that I want to die; it’s just that I want to end the suffering. So hopefully, I’ll find the courage to do that someday. I’ll be counting the seconds… One, two, three, four………….
