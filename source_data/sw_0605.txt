I'm trying to be calm about this but it isn't working.

I wasn't really sure where else to take this, but I need some help. Bad.

A month ago, I started dating this girl. She's absolutely perfect, and I love her to death, even after she decided to break things off two weeks ago. For the first week after, I didn't talk to her, but I couldn't resist so I tried skyping her again. It worked, and we messaged like we used to. I told her I wanted to see her tomorrow, at school, and she said good because she wanted the same. From then, it seemed like things were back on track, kind of. We'd see each other everyday and hug and talk like we did pre-break up. She'd always smile at me during the days too, and I was happy again.

Today, however, I planned to just man up and kiss her, as some sort of attempt at showing her exactly how I still feel. When I saw her, she hugged me shortly, and told me to go away because she had someone coming. I did so, but planned to come back later to do as I said. So I came back later, and she was sitting at her usual table, but there was a guy sitting with her and they were holding hands and chatting away, facing each other.

That really hurt me. I went home early, and have sat in bed since, wondering what I'm going to do. My chest hurts, I can't stop from being ridiculously sad, and I really want to talk to her. I have actually considered the thought of substance abuse, or something like that, but I really want to resist such a terrible thing. It's getting really hard. I wasn't sure where else to go, as all my friends have offered are the usual "Get over her" and "There's plenty of fish in the sea", etc. I really don't want to just let her go, but I'm not sure what else to do anymore.


I just really want to know what to do, and really DON'T want to just let her/it go. Please help.
