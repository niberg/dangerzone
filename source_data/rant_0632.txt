Fuck the Retail System and Being Young

I hate that I have to work these retail jobs until I'm done with college.  Same goes for every 20-something out there with the skills and requirements to do SO MANY other things, but we have to settle with these odd jobs in retail and food service since everything else doesn't want to take us.

These corporate bastards want to rape all of our senses til we are near death, then try to be cute and throw a promotion in there.  The word sounds like a light in a dark cave, when in reality it is a wet match in a misty, dark, cold cave.  They fuck you sideways within this "promotion" and then if you fuck up, you get thrown into an old position.

Then goes to either working too many hours til you can't walk anymore, or working so little that you can't even afford food for the coming weeks.  Choose between being able to stand or eating.  Not in between, which is live comfortably with the hours I was promised while making livable wages to support myself.  All while the higher-ups are sitting at their heated/air conditioned desk sipping on their tea while watching cat videos on YouTube and casually chatting with the office girl Cyndi and thinking of the nice salmon filet dinner they will be having with their mistress when their wife is snorting her Xanax to put the kids to bed.  

Once I get my degree, I'm going to expose all of these corporate bastards I have ever had to slave for, so they can go bankrupt and throw themselves off of the Golden Gate bridge.
