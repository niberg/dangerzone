I'm short, and I'll never be happy.

I live in an area where the average male height is 6ft, and average female is 5 9. Everyone in my family is 6ft or taller, and I'm 5'7. I'm kinda fat, and not that good looking. I'm 22, and I wish I could turn back the clock 4 or 5 years, and go exercise and sleep at night and take multivitamins... But instead I smoked, drank, didn't exercise, ate McDonalds, and rarely slept at night from age 13 to 20. As a result, I stunted my growth, and now I've been thinking about killing myself.

The doctors said I'd be 5ft11. What the fuck happened? 


Girls don't want anything to do with me. Any attempt to hit on girls results in being scoffed at at best, or flat out humiliated.

Guys don't respect me; I'll start to say something in conversation with taller people, and they make eye contact, nonverbally acknowledging that they know I'm trying to speak, and then they will turn their head away and talk to someone else right over me, mid-sentence, as if whatever I have to say is of zero importance. This has happened my entire life, and I can't take it any more. EVERY FUCKING DAY, I think about killing myself. My confidence is in the toilet. God, I wish I was still growing.
