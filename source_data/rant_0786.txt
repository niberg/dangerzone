TV Hate Watching

I need this explained to me. Why watch something if you hate it? No one has a gun to your head forcing you to see this. I went to a TV blog to read about a show I watched last night and everyone, including the reviewer (who I give a pass because it's his job to watch) hated the episode and were pissed off about it. It was even that particular episode, they hated ALL the episodes this season! If I like something, I'll watch. If I don't like something, I don't watch it. It's pretty simple.
