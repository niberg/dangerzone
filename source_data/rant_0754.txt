I spend entirely too much time on this website, and the internet in general, rather than the things that matter: enough's enough.

I'm twenty, and my life has come to stand-still since my Father's illness when I was fifteen.  His Huntington's kicked in *hard* and since then, I've become the 'man of the house'.  My brother got ill on my seventeenth birthday (he has psychotic episodes) and I had to raise my sisters, take care of my brother and Da, whilst trying to get my A-Levels and all the whilst my Ma was out working to support the family.

Since getting 3 B's at A-Level, I had to cancel my plans to go to Univsersity in order to take care of the family, but it's too much man, this won't stop, I need to do what's right for *me!*

I watched a play tonight that my two friends had wrote last year, and offered for me to join in writing with them.  I decided against it as I was too busy with work/family life: I now regret that decision.  The play was great, about forty people showed up (mostly friends/family of the actors/actresses) but it really showed me that I *am* missing out on my life.

I never had the time to be young, and truly live my childhood: racism occurred heavily since I was a kid and Ma didn't let me out much, and by the time I was a teen, I was forced inside by being the primary care-taker of everyone.

Tonight it changes.

- 1 hour a day is dedicated to reading or writing;

- 1 hour block a week is dedicated to analysing/critically thinking about a piece (be it a chapter of a book, a poem, or a short-story);

And Reddit time is being reduced.

An hour before work, and two hours after work.  But see?  Even *that* is fucked up.  My dream isn't to join the karma century club, it's to be a writer.  And yet I dedicate three hours to Reddit and only one to writing/reading in a day?

Fuck these cards I've been dealt.  Just fuck the fuck outta fucking them.  Fucking cunty fucking thing.
