This Depression Will Kill Me

I've been dealing with depression since middle school, I'm now nearly 30. Sometimes I'm great at convincing others (more importantly, myself) that I'm perfectly happy and fine. Other times it's crippling. I've gotten nowhere with my life due to this and major self esteem issues, which I believe are intertwined. People seem shocked to learn these things about me, apparently I can put on a good face. But only for so long. I've burned many bridges because of this. 

I've got two suicide attempts in my past. One was just over a month ago. The downward spiral I'm in now was brought on by a break up with someone I just can't get over. But I don't blame him, this depression has always been inevitable. I was hospitalized for nearly two weeks after this last attempt. I'm on meds and seeing a counselor that only belittles my problems. But hey, what can you do when the help you're getting is free?

I've met someone after my ex. But I don't feel like I can have a healthy relationship with anyone, which just makes me feel more lonely. I keep making wrong choice after wrong choice. I feel like every year I get a little worse rather than better. 

I really don't like myself. People tell me I have so many great qualities and so much going for me, but I just don't see it. I can't stop crying. My mind, more often than not, just thinks of how I won't feel any of this anymore if I just end it. I want to.
