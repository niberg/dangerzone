My life is fucking shit

i apologise for my english as it is not my native language
Ok well, i dont really know where to start but im gonna try anyway
When i was a kid like in kindergarten i got advanced one grade further because i was kinda smart, and that has been the worst fucking thing that has happened to me.
Since primary i have been going to school with kids 1-2 years older, and at that age it really makes the difference. (Im in high school right now, 16 y/o)
As everyone was older than me, i was always the fucking immature kid, the little kid, the short kid, appeared way younger than the other ones, that has brougjt me so many fucking problems, im just gonna list them as it is easier for me that way, not all problems come from the school thing but it was some backstory anyway:
--- ive been heavily bullied since 1st year of primary school by everyone, for every single thing i did or just because it was me: Because im good at math and i like them, because i talk too much, because im annoying, because i did this or that. Everything.
--- i broke my arm when i was 7 and it never really healed and moved a bit weird so i was HORRIBLY bullied because of that when i was like 7 and it ended when i was about 13 or so.
--- ive had to change school several times due to me always feeling like shit in every school.
--- i cried really heavily almost everyday locked in my room, because of several reasons, be it bullying, or that my father treated me like shit or idk.
--- i was about 7 years with a psychologyst, because of all of that shit
--- i was never accepted in any fucking group, everyone rejected me and laughed at me
--- i found escape in videogames but people though i was exagerating so they took them away from me and brought me back to this horrible fucking reality i live in.
--- my mother was sick for like 4 years when i needed her the most and had to go france to heal, she was there for like 3 years, she had cancer, luckily she survived (i live in cancun, mexico)
--- i have never shined in anything, every sport i played i was shit, every thing i did i was shit, only at math i was good, but that was a bad thing because i got shit om because of it.
--- ive never had a girlfriend or anything, there is always someone better than me at anything and more handsome and shit, everytime, i liked some girl and that girl liked another handsome rich idiot.
--- ive always wanted to be someone else, i hate my fucking life and my fucking present and existance.
--- in my dreams, i talk to the girls i like and its beautiful, but when i wake up i realise im a fucking looser and my life sucks dick. I dont even want to wake up every fucking morning because every day is shit.
--- my fucking family makes fun of me everytime because "haha its funny dont take it personal" MY FUCKING ASS.
--- there is always something fucking wrong with me, i always get mocked for something.
--- i say a joke, no one laughs, someone else repeats it, everybody bursts into laughter.
--- i like some girl, try to talk to her, and get fucking ignored, try to do it online, left on seen.
--- i have a friend who has many problems and wants to suicide and ive held him back to do so, but because of that i have anxiety problems and fucking depersonalization and derealization because of it.
--- i have fucking existentional crysis which have brought me to extreme panick attacks and crying for hours straight.
--- my character is shit, i complain for everything and everyone hates me because of it, i talk so much i annoy people horribly, i am so fucking immature, i always say innapropriate things, i cant talk to women without embarrasing myself to death, fuck.
--- i see other guys instagrams, they have comment from the girls id love to go out with or even notice me that say "hot" "wow" "damn", on mine? Fucking nothing.
--- evero other guy is so fucking "cool" has a go pro and a boat and goes out with girls and lifts and blah motherfucking blah, and im a fucking looser who cant do shit.
--- play videogames with someone? A friend or cousin? I do a little mistake and im fucking shouted at for it "fucking idiot"

Im tired of waking up everyday to this horrible reality and to get shut on by everyone, i hate my fucking life

Now that i have a bit of a social life i pretend its all cool, but its not, my lige is shit, ive contemplated suicide since i was about 9 years old or so, and im still thinking about it, only thing is that im so scared of death i dont know if id be able to do it.
