Everyday is exactly the same.

I sleep 12 hours. I wake up, I eat until I can't anymore. I go 7-11 get a slurpee go home and watch youtube videos. I eat while I watch youtube until I get tired 12 hours later. I sleep 12 hours. I do this every single day. Every third day or so i'll add going to the liquor into the mix. Then I do the same thing. This liquid is unpredictable. Sad, Angry, normal, something i'd call happiness? Doesn't matter, it makes me feel something. Anything. It's been this way for 5 years ( Minus the alcohol until 2 years ago.). I don't know what else to do anymore. I fantasize about just ending the cycle sometimes. No job, no school, no social life. I don't even know what i'm hoping to accomplish with this post. Help? Knowing someone feels the same? A warning? I'm not even sure it matters. Never let it get to this point. You stop caring. You want it to end by any means. You may be afraid, but you get tired and lose a bit of yourself each day. I think i'm coming close to the day where the tiredness is too much and I lay down to sleep for the last time.
