"Well, I approve. Good job."

Father in Law worked for GM his whole life.  His pension depends on GM's success.   Still manages to know jack shit about cars and holds GM on a pedestal.  He tries to talk me into splurging on a new camaro every time I see him.   So when I bought my Subaru after a lifetime of research, he was disappointed.  After looking the car over and "teaching me" the location of the air filter and other obvious shit, he sat me down and announced with much fanfare that he "approves".   Oh well la dee da.  Good for you.
