I feel lonely

I don't really connect with people anymore. I'm outgoing and I can make friends just fine but I feel like there's never going to something I can deeply connect with.

Someone who understands my experiences, shares hobbies and interests, likes the same music as me, same type of humor.

Someone who appreciates the same things I do and shares the same values.

I want to connect with my mom, family, friends, my best friend and the boy I'm head over heals for.

It's not working though and it's making me really lonely. I'm sad and I wish I could just take a nap for the rest of my life.
