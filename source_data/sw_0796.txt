Everything fell apart.

Everything was going well until a little over a week ago.

Now I have nothing.

In March my therapist told me to kill myself.

I am not on any mood stabilizers now.

All I have is 70-75mg of Klonopin and a few Lunesta. I'm thinking of downing it all but I don't think that would be enough.

I've cut in the past. I don't want to make too much of a mess though.

I should have died in June of this year but some people realized I wouldn't wake up and somehow saved me (overdosed then as well).

Why am I here? There is no point. Things fall apart and everything turns to shit. Over and over again.
