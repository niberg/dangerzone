Shy, not autistic

My parents are convinced I have autism. I used to be extremely shy, played better with myself than others, read instead of playing football. They don't see, won't see that I've changed. I have friends, more importantly I'm interested in keeping those friends - because I like them, not just to 'fit in' in society.

 So what I get a little nervous when I meet new people? Does a modicum of anxiety mean I have a mental disorder? I don't think so, but there's no way without sounding so strange that I can get this across to them, communicate to them that I'm not how I used to be in primary school. I've grown, I'm learning, why can't you see that?
