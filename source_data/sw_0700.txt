Out of methods

If I could drive I would just drive to a cliff somewhere and jump. All I have at home is taking pills that either will not kill me or will cause very intense pain. No gun, no rope, nothing. I am lonely and talk to nobody so no access to the outside world other than TV and shit which doesn't show much obviously.

I have my family who half I cant stand or don't even know. Only have my mom who I think can't understand my problems. I can't feel love at all. I can't feel anything but negative stuff. November might be nice but December will be crash and burn. With this I am questioning whether or not I should live it out because I don't think it will mean anything. Depression will always run my mind.
