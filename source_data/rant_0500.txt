Atheists think they're so fucking smarter then the rest of the world.

I'm don't believe in god, but I don't like to call myself an Atheist because this word, for me, is related with a bunch of people who think they're much better, smarter, just for not believing in god. Just because a group of famous scientists don't believe in god, it doesn't mean the average christian is "dumber" then the average atheist. Also, on the atheism subreddit faq, there is one question that is "should I tell my parents im an atheist?" the answer is No. Go fuck your fucking self, that basically means that /r/atheism redditors are a bunch of loses that think they're better than the world but arent brave enough to tell their own parents? gimme a fucking break.
