Ebay Is Dog Shit~

For some reason ever since a few weeks ago I often have to reload the sell page on Ebay. It isn't on my end and it happens with all of my browsers.

I listed a lot of (luckily) non-valuable Pokemon cards. Put it at 7 days so it would end on Saturday night. Now I find out their stupid system fucked up and it's listed at 5 days.. so it will end on Thursday night.

Thanks for losing me money, Ebay!
