Co-workers at times do my head in

Specifically two, although neither of them work with me any more, because they both left. Also, the names have been changed.

##Tania

People generally seem to like her. I don't. She seems to be a 'zany' person but I don't personally call being a bitch 'zany'. This woman, whom I had not seen before, never said anything to me aside from "Shut up, Tony" even if I had something that I needed to ask her. Ugh. It would have been alright if we were both old friends and this was some running joke but this is not the case. I don't know where I'm going with this but it just makes me angry. **Tania, if you're reading this: It's your hen night tonight. I hope you get left at the altar.**

##Pam
I just want you to call me by my real name. My name, while the short form for a common name, is my name. I have never once called myself 'Anthony' because it is not my name. You steadfastly refused to call me 'Tony' so you can go fuck yourself with a harpoon.

**I'm glad I don't work with you two anymore.**
