My dad is so nonsensible...

Heres some backstory.

It was morning, i was about to go to school when my dad calls and tells me that he forgot to drink his milk (lol) and tells me to drink it for him so its not wasted. Well, I was busy getting ready so I couldn't really fit this into my routine. So I just forgot. It's just milk right? Whatever.

He comes home later, finds the milk still on the counter, while i completely forgot about it. He doesn't necessarily yell, but he puts on this condescending face and voice, and proceeds to harp me for not drinking the milk. This whole time I'm thinking, "It's just fucking milk, why does he have to get so angry about this shit" 

So he continually repeats "Why didn't you drink it" in this annoyingly patronizing voice, and when I say straight up "I just forgot", he does this annoying ass thing that he always does when i say i forgot something. He says "I forgot" in this mocking voice, apparently trying to mimic me. And then that's usually the end of my "lecture"

He always gets so fucking worked up over the littlest things. He tells me to close the blinds at night because hes afraid someones going to look inside, like what the fuck? We're elevated, plus I doubt that would happen where we live, a townhouse area. He ALWAYS goes off on this like it's some big fucking deal, like, I'll go and do it now then, what's the fucking rush? 

Maybe I'm just looking at it wrong, but from my current perspective, its fucking ridiculous.
