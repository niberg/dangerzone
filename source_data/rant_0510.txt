a rant in the form of a poem

you know what i want?

i want to spend EACH DAY OF MY LIFE

not worrying that

one of the most important people of my life

won't appear in court over some fucking 

stupid marijuana charges

i don't want to worry that

a douchebag cop can jeopardize someone's life

a life that i'm apart of

a life that means the world to me

i don't want to think that

by the time that important person turns 40

we'll have already had warnings from several doctors

i don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on

court appearances

because that important person almost took another important person's life

i don't want that on my conscious


i don't want to be anxious everyday


assuming that you're playing with fire

and worrying if i'm in too deep to leave

worrying if i can even leave

worrying that if i'll have to leave when it's tough

....

around that corner

there's a long way into the future

and i just want the best one

for that important person and i
