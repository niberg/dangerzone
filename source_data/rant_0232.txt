Burning bridges

I don't care about the shit that went down between you and my husband, and I don't care that you made the choice to act like a spoiled brat instead of a grown ass woman towards one of my best friends.
This is between you and me. The fact is that I stood up for you (putting my marriage at risk in the process), time and time again because I thought we were friends. I listened to you when you would come to me with your problems and would keep what was said between us because I thought we were friends. I did the very best I could to be hospitable towards you. I gave you cigarettes when you asked, I let you borrow my hygiene products, and let you into my home because I thought we were fucking friends. You keep burning bridges and then getting pissed because you've isolated yourself and nobody even wants to help you any more. Thanks for adding me to the list. You block everyone in this house after one person stands up to you? Fuck that.
The ONLY two reasons I don't say this to your face are because I know it would escalate into a screaming match in your house (a courtesy you couldn't award me) And because one of us has to have an ounce of respect for Sean. Good luck in all your future endeavors. I hope you can grow up some day and that the woman I thought I was friends with can actually come around again.
Tl;dr? No more mrs. nice guy. Consider this bridge burned.
