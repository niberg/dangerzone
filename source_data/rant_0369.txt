Girlfriend's mom.

So I'm a freshman in college and my girlfriend is a senior in high school. I don't get to see her too often which is why our trip to Disney World meant so much to her and I. Her parents got a hotel about 40 minutes away from where I go to school, and so I met up with them there. I was told by her dad that it was okay that I didn't have the money right then to pay for my ticket. Well, apparently everyone wasn't on the same page because her mom asked me to giver her the money. I told her I didn't have it and she called me irresponsible. I told her I could get it to her tomorrow(which I could) but she persisted on calling me a liar. I was livid inside but I decided to play it cool. Early in the day my girlfriend receives a text saying that I'm childish and need to grow up. I get that she was angry about me not having the money, but I thought it was understood that it was okay for me not having it. It's just so annoying because I feel like she's always out to get me and there's nothing I can do.
