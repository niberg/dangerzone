I had to fire someone today.

I never even wanted to be the boss.  They fucking laid off everyone else.  I got promoted against my will.  I'm stressed out, I don't sleep well, my face is breaking out like a teenager--I've not had this many zits since high school--it's 12 hour days, I get no actual work done, it's just meetings and conference calls and problem solving while the actual work piles up.  

And today they make me fire someone.  I had to say yes.  I had to agree with them, this person wasn't working out.  This was a perfectly nice person but they have issues.  Showing up late consistently, extended lunch hours, overly lengthy breaks, unwillingness to learn some things...this is just not the job for this person.  I hated saying it, I hated having to be the person to make the final call and I loathed even more having to tell them.  

This isn't what I signed up for.  

I could really use a drink.
