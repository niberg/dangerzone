Really need your guys advice

I found out tonight that my best friend back home last night tried to commit suicide. She was drunk and took a glass to her wrist. I am in another country for university and I am going home to see her for the weekend. 

How should I approach this situation? What is the best way for me to be supportive through this? Are there any questions to avoid? 

I'm pretty clueless, I just want to be there for her.
