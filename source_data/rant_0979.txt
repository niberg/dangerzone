What. THE FUCK. Ever.

I do my best to be as good as I can possibly be. I do everything you say and I make sure you have everything you need. Yet you still bash me and say I am not doing enough. You still make me look like the fucking bad guy. If I ever try to calmly tell you that some of the things you do are unfair, haha in the end I am always the one apologizing. You never want to admit that you are wrong. You NEVER want to admit that you make mistakes. you never want to be the one on the other side. You are never in trouble. Well fuck you. Fuck your damn ego. I am a human god damned being and I am allowed to make mistakes and IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TELL ME THE SHIT I DO WRONG THEN GOD DAMNIT I AM ALLOWED TO DO THE SAME FUCKING THING! I gave up EVERYTHING to fucking live here with you. I know you love me. I know you would move mountains for me. But god damn just let me fucking tell you how you are the way you tell me how I am without it starting WWIII.

What sucks the most Reddit, is that no matter what I fucking say or do, its never enough. There is always "room to improve".

Excuse me for having feelings and opinions.

I do not need anyone's advice. I just needed to rant. Thank you for this sub.
