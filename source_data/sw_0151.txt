Where did I go wrong in life?

I'm 18. And I just feel done. Nothing is going right. Nothing seems to have a good outcome. I work 10-12 hours a day trying to survive. But I am always broke and behind in bills. I've sold all my possessions that aren't a necessity to survive. Just so I can have some more money. I feel like I hit rock bottom. I'm just tempted to go for a drive and hit a wall. Hope I don't get up from it....
