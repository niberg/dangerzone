Its always my fault

Yes it was my fault for drinking as much as I did. Yes it was my fault for attempting to choke my girlfriend. However, her kicking and biting me to "wake me up" is not my fault. My PTSD from my military service (which shes aware of) is also not my fault. So sorry if I felt a little threatened when I wake up at 6am still kinda drunk and freak out when someone starts kicking my ass. Now shes trying to press charges on me even though she was the aggressor (and does this regularly to "wake me up") even when Im not drinking. Now I have to leave my home, move away and hope she doesnt try to pursue me. And the reason I have to do this is because the fucking police NEVER believe that the woman is the aggressor. Run or go to jail. Awesome. Oh I forgot to mention that shes broken my windshield  $250, my vape $100 and assaulted me without provocation and now wants to pin this one on me. Fucking BULLSHIT. Ive literally taken bullets for this country then I come home and this is how Im treated? FUCK IT. FUCK AMERICA, FUCK WOMEN AND FUCK THE POLICE. I have no one to turn to, nowhere to go and no one gives a shit. My roommate barely batted an eye when I told him I had to move out on short notice. No one wants me around. SO FUCKING FINE. Ill leave. Ill go away and just hermit it up for the rest of my life. Whatever. Fuck you assholes that treat me horribly and then act like Im the one with a problem when I make one mistake.
