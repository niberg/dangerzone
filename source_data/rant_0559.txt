Rant about a liar

You're probably going to see this, you're probably going to know this is about you, but you know what, it is what it is. Im tired of it and I've BEEN tired of it.

You shouldn't have lied about your miscarriage. You saw a fetus in the toilet? You said you were pregnant for three weeks. THREE WEEKS. Did you really think I believed that?
On top of that, then you suddenly had fertility problems? I don't think you understand how angry this comment of yours made me after I realized you were probably lying, because there is a good chance that I WILL. 
And suddenly: BREAST CANCER. Out of fucking no where. Are you getting treatment for it? No, of course you aren't.
And then after breast cancer it's diabetes. And also heart attacks. Which someone calmed you down from. NEWSFLASH: YOU CANNOT BE CALMED DOWN FROM A HEART ATTACK. 
But it wasn't a heart attack right? It was an anxiety attack, yeah, an anxiety attack because that sounds more believable...until I mentioned that I have been diagnosed with anxiety problems, then you just drank too much caffeine.
Then it's Asthma, water in your lungs, and ovarian cysts.
You know what you have? MUNCHAUSEN SYNDROME
AS IN, YOU FAKE YOUR FUCKING DISEASES FOR ATTENTION.
Y'know, with that many problems in one year with no treatment, YOU WOULD BE DEAD. 

But enough about your fifty fucking diseases, now we gotta talk about your love life.

We both know your main crush. He knows it too. And you know what you did? YOU LIED ABOUT THAT TOO. I FUCKING ASKED HIM MYSELF BECAUSE 
I
WAS
CONCERNED
FOR
YOU
AND THEN I FOUND OUT YOU WERE LYING THROUGH YOUR FUCKING TEETH
Can't forget that you tried to hit on every single guy friend of ours, and our girl friend (Friend who is a girl, not date/relationship, obviously). Oh, and THEN you told her that MY BOYFRIEND AND I WANTED TO HAVE A THREESOME WITH HER? WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK. WHY WOULD YOU MAKE UP THAT LIE? FOR WHAT PURPOSE IS THAT.

Better yet, why lie about anything? Why hint that you're dating two guys who we both know you're not dating? Why do that and then get ANGRY when I call you out on it? 

Well you know what, if i'm on your dark side, fine, i'll deal with that. At least you won't be lying to me anymore.
