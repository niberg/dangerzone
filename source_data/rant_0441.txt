On having kids...

I was recently dumped by someone because they decided they wanted kids. We have known each other for over three years and the entire time we dated we were laughing. Not a single other argument. 

So I asked, why do you want kids? The answers:

- To show my dad.

Wait really? Thats a reason to have kids? You are going to go through 20 years of childcare so that you can have one moment where you show your dad to...make him proud? I mean, anyone can make kids, its the easiest thing to do in life. Raising them is another story. It just seems like a dumb way to make your parents proud.

- So my parents have grandchildren.

Okay, back to the parents. Do you realize you don't have to live for other people? You have yet to actually say that YOU want kids. You just want them for other people. That might not keep you going for 20 years.

- So my DNA will be passed on.

Now, smart attractive people should probably have kids, but still, what are you going to tell your kid? I always wanted a DNA capsule to carry on our family legacy! Plus, then you are starting this whole "I need kids for my dad" cycle all over again.

- To have someone to share things with.

Hello?! I'm right here, and we have all the same interests. You can't put any weight into your kid being interested in the same things you are. Maybe you love video games but your kid just wants to play football. Now you're a shitty parent.

- To take care of me when we're older.

Oh yes, kids will "take care" of you by getting you a one-way ticket to the nursing home. I'm not saying kids are heartless, I'm saying try taking care of a parent or elderly loved one from home. You will know why people want assisted suicide to be legal.



As far as I'm concerned, you should only want kids for one reason, to help mentor someone into a productive member of society. Kids aren't "yours" they are people. Just like when you get married your significant other doesn't become "yours." With that in mind, you can help mentor lots of kids and make a greater impact if you volunteer or teach. 

So yeah, it's a bit dumb to leave a perfect relationship for kids. Get off your butt and help the kids that are already here.



(Ex, if you are reading this (you reddit junkie you) I wish you would have thought about this more. I love you, and you didn't even educate yourself on the topic of kids before leaving. You hurt me.)
