If God exists, I think he wants me to kill myself.

It feels like my life is a game that is being watched on the sidelines.  Beings have placed their bets on how long will it take for me to kill myself.  I think about it everyday.  Maybe I am overly sensitive.  I don't think I am cut out for this planet.  I am too soft.
