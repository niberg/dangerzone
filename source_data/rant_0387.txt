Can't stand shitty creatives

I'm freelancing at this super shitty "branding agency." Dough and hours are great, but the absolute garbage creative is starting to kill me.

I work with these graphic designers who are just goddamn terrible. No one here knows how to make shit look good on paper or on a screen - their sole goddamn job.

They also have no idea what a creative idea or concept is. I'm trying to teach them, but they look at me slack jawed when I try to explain how to marry words and imagery into a unique, interesting piece.

Ugh, this is a stupid industry (marketing/branding/advertising) at best, but still it's satisfying to do good work.

I can't keep being associated with this total shit ass trash creative.
