Bad month

I just don't really care anymore like I almost jumped off my towns bridge a couple weeks ago, but i decided to wait and sell all my stuff first. You see i have a lot if shit piling all at once and something snapped. I Really wasn't afraid I really was "settled" and okay with dying. Now its hard to explain but it's weird. I was so resolved i planned my death and i was going to try carbon monoxide but the garage was locked. I feel like i have no one to talk to and im lonely haha... I just dont see the point in living like...what is there for me? well i posted on reddit because I just needed to express my feelings because I really have nobody to talk about this with me haha! Im not seeking attention and im sorry if it sounds, like I am. I really dont care about that!
