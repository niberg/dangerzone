I need advice/help...

So i have been hesitant to post anything here because i don't want to insult anyone who perhaps has worse problems than mine...but i really just need some help or advice on how to deal with this shit.

I am going to be pretty frank and to the point. 3 weeks ago, my girlfriend of 3 years left me high and dry...almost out of nowhere, she left me for another guy and then rubbed it in my face. We had an extremely intense relationship and for all 3 years up to this point, we were extremely happy together. 2 weeks ago, my grandma passed away due to Parkinson's and now i just feel so lost and hopeless.

After my girlfriend left me, i feel as if i have lost a piece of myself and just feel as if everything is hopeless, then with the added toll of my grandma passing i have just hit rock bottom. It has been 3 weeks now, and i still feel as if life is hopeless. I am currently in college and my grades have all slipped, i cant focus on anything, i cant sleep, i cant eat and all my friends have left me because they cant be around my depressed self. 

I just don't know what to do anymore and death seems like a good option, i cant see anyone who would miss me. I need help on how to stop thinking like this
