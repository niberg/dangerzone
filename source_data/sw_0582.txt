I could use some help and advice.

A couple of weeks ago, my friend had an absolute breakdown. He sold every single piece of electronic he owned and bought a gun. He was going to kill himself but decided not to. I tried convincing him to sell it and use the money to buy a ps4 again so he can play with us, his group of friends, but he's not having it. I'm extremely worried. I want him to have something to keep his mind off of it and enjoy himself with us again. We've tried inviting him out but he was in an accident a few years ago that really messed up his back. I am so scared of losing one of my best friends. Idk what to do.
