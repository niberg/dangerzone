I Don't Want To Wake Up

I'm 20 years old, and I'm scared. I didn't know where to turn so I just need to say this to anyone who is willing to care.

I've dealt with depression since I was 12. It's always been my future that scares me the most, in that I don't think I have one worth experiencing. I feel like such a waste of space and resources. I have no skills, I'm dropping out of college after half a semester, I work a minimum wage part time job and I hate my life.

Recently I've been going through a downward spiral mentally and slipping back into my depression. Just as this was happening I found out Monday that my gf cheated on me. I hate myself even more because I was willing to say she made a mistake and that we can fix it. She doesn't want to. I feel so crushed. Crushed by life, by society, and by the love I thought I had. 

I'm miserable and fail everything I do. I just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. I want to go to the overpass near my house and jump off. Please someone help me.....
