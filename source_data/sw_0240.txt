Sometimes I think that ending it all is the right thing to do.

So for a long time I've been doing my normal day to day life which in all honesty is pretty fucking weird as a hobby I like to climb around buildings and take photo's of what happens. I've become pretty popular through doing this on a social media site but the underlying reason for ever starting to do this was that every time I would look down from a high place I would think about what it was like to just take the fall, I don't think anyone but my family would actually care. It's just so seductive as a way to end all of the superficial problems that I have.. Imagine it just to walk off the edge and just end. honestly I don't really know how this works or should work but right now I feel like finding the highest thing and just jumping off to have that final relief of what it would be like. My life just seems like a never ending tale of proving myself everytime in life someone keeps telling me that I'm not good enough or I'm not right for them and it all sucks I've just had enough I really just want to die and fuck the world just fuck it all I've really had enough.
