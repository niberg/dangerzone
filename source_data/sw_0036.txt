Fear of eternal damnation because of sexuality. I want to die.

I'm a lesbian, and even though I logically am pretty agnostic and don't believe in an afterlife, I am still so terrified of going to hell for being in a gay relationship. I have no idea what to do.

This started a year and a half ago and I was able to come out of it, but I've never fully gotten over it, I guess. Logically, in my mind, I know being gay is fine and that if there is a god, if he was just, he wouldn't care because he made me like this.

But logic and anxiety do not go together at all. I was triggered yesterday and I have had constant terror to the point where I can hardly do anything (haven't eaten in over 24 hours and can barely sleep), and my mind won't stop trying to rationalize. Here's my process:

1. I know that I won't go to hell because it doesn't exist/god doesn't exist. Even if he does, many Christians think that he accepts gays. But then I wonder, what if they're wrong? What if he isn't just and he'll punish me forever in eternal pain in hell for being in a gay relationship?

2. Even if I do accept that logically this makes no sense, what if I can't get out of this? What if I have to end a relationship with a girl I'm in love with to fix this? I've had issues with this before and come out of it, but it almost cost me my life. I can't do that again.

Please help me. How do I learn how to accept myself and realize I won't be eternally punished by a god I don't even believe in?
