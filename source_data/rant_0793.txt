Fuck you English class

We have a thing called round table, where at the start of class someone presents a question and we have a class discussion on the answer. Every person in the class gets the same grade based on how well we answer the question.

We can only talk so many times, because the idea is for everyone to talk. BUT NOBODY ANSWERS THE QUESTION. No matter how many times I or someone else says "let's stay on topic" we get off topic and get a shitty grade.

This is fucking my average over. Fuck.
