I don't have a purpose.

I've given up so much for the person I loved... and I never got anything in return, and he told me he wasn't one for romance but that he loved me and he would tell me every day...

And then I got a hunch and looked at his phone when he was in the shower and I find out he's been cheating on me for over a year. And a our friends knew about it and did not tell me. Everyone I knew and loved knew about it and yet wouldn't tell me. I have since cut off everybody but my mother, father and brother. Thats it.

He said it was because I was sexually abnormal, that I wasn't wet enough, that he didn't feel like he turned me on. He said it was because he needed sex to live, and I wasn't enough for him and that I probably wouldn't be able to find anyone else who would be happy with me even though I went to multiple doctors and tried different solutions to no avail. I WAS turned on, but I was still dry, and he thought using lube was not a solution. And that it wouldn't be for any future partners ahead.

I don't know. I don't even want to live any more.
