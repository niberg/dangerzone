The humans scare me

They do. Not all the time but most of the time. Is it anxiety? Something else? A curse or a blessing or nothing at all. I don't know and the fact that I don't know is scaring me. I'm alone and why run from these thoughts, they've been happening for probably as long as I can remember is it just the truth? Have I been running from the truth? I guess so. But why? Is it because the world isn't made for the truth? Am I not made for the truth? Please help me
