I feel like I could actually lose control

I've struggled with depression on and off. For the record, I also have a bad case of purely obsessional OCD.

Just a bit of background: I really started getting into philosophy and religion about two and a half years ago, and today I consider myself an atheist.

However, recently I have come across a philosophy called anti-natalism, which pretty much answers the question *is it better to have lived or to have never lived at all?* as to be the latter.

This philosophical position has really made me depressed, and it's starting to scare me because it makes me feel like I could just off myself right now. Get it over with. I wouldn't ever have children, and wouldn't have to suffer a single bit of pain ever again. I would be non-existent, without a conscious, and wouldn't know what happened. I would be gone, all sensations would be gone, no pleasure nor pain.

It scares me mostly because I can't find a good reason *not* to off myself right now. What on earth is keeping me going? If suffering is not negated by pleasure, it seems like the logical thing to do would be to kill myself if I dropped my pencil, or stubbed my toe. It sounds absurd but I can't find any other reason to not do so.

I've lost a great amount of interest in what I used to find interesting. I have always loved space, and planned on going into the aerospace/mechanical engineering field, designing stuff that we would use as a species to get to other planets and spread the human race. But if anti-natalism is true, there's absolutely no point whatsoever, in fact it would be harmful for me to go into such a field that would essentially be keeping the human species alive.

I feel like if I was a dictator, the most logical thing to do would be to blow up the entire world with a bunch of bombs. It's horrible.

I need others' opinions on this.
