this is my first post.

I did something really bad last saturday. It wasn't entirely my fault, but I am responsible for it. I was abused when I was younger and sometimes I do things that I don't mean to in my sleep. I used to get night terrors or talk in my sleep. I hurt someone really badly. I had been doing really well with friends, I have asperger's and depression. Now, I think i am going to lose them all. and I deserve it. I feel myself thinking like I used to, wanting to die. I've tried a few times before, but not in a long long time. I cut myself earlier, but it hasn't helped like it used to. I don't know, but this time, I feel like i deserve it.
