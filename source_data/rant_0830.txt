Is anyone else tempted to put a sign on the drive-thru menu that says "limit 3 meals per customer"?

The drive-thru is there for people who want to grab a meal on the way somewhere, but every other customer at my restaurant uses it to order enough food for 12 people. Thanks to these people, everyone behind them who ordered one or two tacos has to wait 5 minutes for them, and corporate gets furious because we can't make 4 dozen tacos in under a minute. If you want that much food, get out of the car and walk into the building. I promise you that much exercise won't kill you.
