I wish...

I could just unshackle my every intention of killing myself. Of letting me hit rock bottom, burn all bridges behind me and leave me with only one option left on the table.

I'm miserable all the time. I hate and I'm hated. My hypothetical suicide would be a middle finger towards everyone who has ever wronged me. I want people to look at my carcass and feel a petty and false sense of regret. I want to feel avenged through their regrets. I want to teach them a lesson and show them that they've pushed me too far. I want them to know what it means to feel guilt-ridden as I have known for most of my life.

It's petty and cruel of me to think this way, but it's how I feel. All the more reason I shouldn't live. I'm filled with venom. With each passing day, I'm becoming more and more convinced that I'm going to end up killing myself.
