I think I have borderline personality disorder

I've started reading about it and everything makes sense now. I've never been violent with people and I've never done anything extreme, but I'm a terrible, terrible person and now I understand why. And from what I've read about it, other people aren't so fond of people like me, either. I'm never going to find love or a healthy relationship, I'm never going to find someone who won't run away, and you know what, I don't deserve that, because if someone does fall in love with me I'll just fuck everything up and ruin their lives. That's all I'm good at, ruining people's lives. I think I'm going to kill myself and spare everyone the pain that I'll inevitably cause them later on. There are people who love me but I don't deserve it and I'm just going to hurt them and fuck everything up so I might as well get it over with now.
