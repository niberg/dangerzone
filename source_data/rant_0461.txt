If I could ride my bike or drive my car just one day and not get almost killed/cursed at in this city...

It always kinda ruins my day when someone yells that I'm a bitch or whatever when I'm just observing traffic laws. I try to have a lot of love in my heart and be nice to people, and it just crushes my spirit when people spew rage into the world.

Today I was on my bike, in the small margin to the right of a car (no bike lane), waiting at a red light to go straight ahead. The car had the right turn signal on so it was going to turn towards me but there was a steady flow of traffic so she wasn't able to turn until the light changed. As soon as the light turned green, the driver honked at me. There was no one else at the intersection so it was def at me. 

I looked back at her instead of going straight ahead, wondering why she was honking, and she gestured like she wanted me to wait for her to turn right around me. I ignored her and biked ahead, since it was my right of way and the light was green.

As I cross the intersection, I hear her squeal through her right turn and scream "YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE" at me. 

I guess she was in a hurry to get into the stop-n-go traffic on the 101 :(
