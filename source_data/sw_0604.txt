I fell stupid but I need to say something

I hate doing this as it seems like i'm desperate for attention but I need to get it off my chest. Firstly, you should know I am 14. So last year my nan and grandad both died. This really affected me as I was very close to them and really affected me. It caused me to do some really stupid things like smoking. Stealing money, bunking school and getting angry towards everyone (im in top sets at school so this was noted by teachers). I got really agressive and angry. Then at the start of this year, my dad left. For this whole year my mum had made it seem like he was so bad. I said some things that make me cringe today to my dad but luckily he understood and we are now very close. Throughout the year things like school, friends and family all seemed to weigh down on me. I was diagnosed with depression and I just seemed to be getting worse as the days past. For this year I had suicide in my mind. It got worse and worse. I would break down crying, bursts of anger etc. The only reason i'm here is because I haven't had the guts to do it yet. Anyway, it doesn't seem to be getting better and I don't know how long i can continue. Thanks for listening.
