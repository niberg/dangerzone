Want some advice

I'm a 15 year old guy and honestly I have a pretty great life. I'm athletic, social, smart, attractive, from a very affluent family etc... For the past 3 months however I've been sad and having multiple daily suicidal thoughts. My mind is also foggy often, I'm having trouble concentrating and thinking straight a lot. As a result my grades have suffered and I've dropped out of honour roll. I don't see a point in life right now. I hate school and I have at least 4-5 years left of it. The only time that I really enjoy life is when I'm drunk. But some days I'll have a good day or at least a normal one where I don't think about my funeral. When I first started high school my family was told by a teacher of 30 years that I was the brightest student he'd ever met. Today I make stupid mistakes and I say stupid things in front of people. I also have stopped enjoying my friends companionship and have frequent headaches. I've also gone from being a Catholic to agnostic.

Sorry for the rambling/incoherent post I just want this off of my chest it's been bothering me for a while. What I'm really asking is what caused this change?
