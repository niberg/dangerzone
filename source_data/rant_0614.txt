No, you are not entitled to your own opinion.

MESSAGE:
When in the broad scope of human development, your opinion should only matter when it supports the development of the human race as a whole.
To our knowledge and belief, this has been the best subliminal rule of thumb to support the pursuit of happiness which so happens to be included in the States as one of their inalienable laws by birth. 

Question: Do we even have opinions that are infringing human development?

Answer: Yes, racists, sexists, religious extremists.

Question: But aren't they justified in their own opinion?

Answer: You can justify your own opinion the same way you can give meaning to your abstract art and sell it for $10,000. As beautiful as they may find it, it is slowing down the mental development of our fully capable minds. 

MESSAGE: Sexists, Racists, Religious extremists, you are not entitled to your own opinion because you have become fucking viruses in this new era of the world. We are becoming more open-minded and to many close-minded individuals this is a scary thought. We need to help each other by becoming more understanding in order to really achieve this "World Peace" that has been so deeply fantasized that it seems unreachable. 

There is no superior race, there is no superior gender, there is no superior religion so stop being arrogant fucks and get over yourselves. 

Oh yeah P.S, to Mr. or Ms. Flaming Homophobe, get over yourself as well. Love is a taste and you are belittling people for their tastes because you believe your taste is better or more divine.
