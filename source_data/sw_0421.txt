Maybe I should do it tonight? No one cares.

Idk if this matters, but I'm a black female. I'm suffering from chronic loneliness and severe depression, but I have no support system. I used to really focus on my personal life and making sure my friends were okay, but they don't care about me anymore. So what tips do you guys have so that I can make only my professional life matter? I can't deal with this pain. Or should I just end it if I can't cope? No depression treatment works and now I have nobody. I'm an aspiring biomedical researcher btw. Pre-PhD right now doing infectious disease research in a biomedical engineering department. My ultimate professional goal is to work for a national lab doing similar research. Only if things improve.
