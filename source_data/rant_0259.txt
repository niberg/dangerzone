it's not a contest, it's not about who's winning and it's not about who's turn it is to be on top

Discrimination is a 2 way street, anyone can either discriminate or be discriminated against. No matter what gender, race, religion, social class, whether you came from a city, suburb, rural background, whether you were abused or sheltered, got good grades or flunked out of high school, went to college or not, have a mental illness or not, you are still a person and being discriminated against hurts no matter what.

No matter what group you are part of you are also capable of being the person or people doing the discriminating as well. We are both capable of being the villain or victim.

We all have our feelings and they are important to us because we feel them all the time and everyday and sometimes in a very profound way and it hurts no matter what when people belittle us for what we are and don't care about who we are.

Maybe it's not about whose turn it is to be on top or in power and whose turn it is to hurt others and be the ones doing the discriminating, but just about being treated equally and fairly and be judged by how we treat others and by our character rather than just labeling each other.

SO STOP MAKING EXCUSES JUST SO YOU CAN GO HATING ON EACH OTHER!!!!!!!
