Struggling to keep going at the moment.

I'm here to see if this helps at all, I have not spoken to anyone about this face to face ever, posted a few things in the past on over accounts but today it has got so much worse.

I was with the love of my life, for 10 years from the age of 15, we had a house together and was planning a family, our of no where she informs me she isn't happy and moved out our house.

We not really had any contact over the last 6 months and I stopped going out, and fell in to depression for the first time in my life (and finally now understand the grip it takes, after years of not understanding it). I go out late at night to do my groceries shop when I can muster up the energy just to avoid people I may know.

Well after 6 months of this and occasionally trying new things to try and shake this grasp on me, I have failed and feel like I am on my final straw.

Last night I saw her for the first time in 6 months to discuss what is going to happen to the house and I am sure in the next few months I will be homeless, but that's not really an issue if life carries on like this.

We spoke about the house and after the initial hour of it being awkward we really relaxed and things felt like old times, it was happiest I have been in such a long time. Then time came for her to go and now I worry I will never feel like this again. I am cutting my self off slowly from the world.

Just no idea how long I can keep living like this.
