Just watched "For No Good Reason". Johnny Depp should read Jeff Noons "Vurt" instead of repeatedly promoting old gonzo/road movie fogey bore.

At least someone should recognize and depict the much greater and larger psychedelic that was the 90s. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vurt]("Vurt") is one example. A good lot of other good examples can be found in the compilation "Disco Buiscuits". 
Gawd I´m bored to death with Hunter Thompson and the ancients of that time! By now the 90s are quite a bit aways aswell but still there hasen´t been a proper disection of the psychedelic gonzo of that era.
