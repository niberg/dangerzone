How the ever loving fuck..is it so hard. To have Cheese only burger?

I do not understand. What is so bloody difficult to put nothing but cheese on a burger. And it's not the chain fast food. It's these fancy restaurants that claim "5 stars" or "Best service" yet if not 9/10 can't get simple orders right. 

After already taking 30 mins to cook a burger then toss everything on it "Just because" what was the point in coming and taking the order in the first god damn place.

I'm not asking you to do a triple back flip out of a plane to stab the legendary Cow on Mount Fugi and get the finest beef cook it to absolute perfection then make perfect america cheese with the flawless golden tone to it.

Just a Cheese Burger. Cheese Only. Nothing on the fucking side which soaks into the entire bun.

It's not accidents it's Lazyiness. Because I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who doesn't like veggies or mustard on his burger. 

I never go out to eat aside from Pizza because you can't mess up Pizza. And if you do I don't know whats wrong with you..

This has happened every single time I've asked for a burger at several separate non-commercial restaurants.

What's **EVEN WORSE** is when they just take it in the back, throw off the veggies and bring back the same burger like someones stupid.

If I'm play 10$ for this Angus Beef burger. And you want a tip. Get shit right. **SERIOUSLY**. 

I've worked in food service for 4 years. Shit only gets wrong if you're careless or truly don't care. 

Then you get an attitude when I politely ask when you bring the already messed up order "Eh, I just wanted Cheese and nothing on the side.."

What. You're mad that you fucked up? Oh excuse me then.

But since I've gotta wait for another 20 mins for something that shouldn't have been wrong in the first place, I **SHOULD** be mad. But I try to conduct things in a mild tone.

But this is a constant thing and it's fucking ridiculous.
