My fucking housemates. Why do I live here.

First off before I rant, I only knew one of the people I was going to live with this year.

In my 3rd year of uni and sharing a house with 3 other people. We will call them Simon and John.

Simon my best friend and the person I knew I was going to live with does nothing but uni work. NOTHING. This is my only complaint, I ask him to go out or play some games but nope to much stuff to do or to tired. Fair enough you have got a lot of work to do but you NEED down time. You never give yourself any what so ever! This does not bother me to much, just makes me a little sad because we can't be that close because he does nothing but work.

Now John. OH MY FUCKING GOD. How much shit do you eat? Takeaways 4 times a week? 2 large pizzas to yourself over a day? He is a big guy and does nothing to help himself. The amount of fizzy drinks he consumes is unbelievable it would make any normal person feel sick. I am talking at least a 2 litre bottle of coke a day along side numerous cans. I see take away burger boxes 5 at a time on the kitchen table, most of them gone by the morning. Come on man, get your shit together makes me feel sick to think someone could do that to themselves. Thanks for never cleaning the toilet Along with this....thanks for breaking the toilet seat and leaving it, yeah and I would say something to him but wait!!! He does not come out his room. EVER. Not seem him in around 6 days, I can hear him. But when I have time to talk to him he is asleep, at 6pm.... and then stays awake till 5am.... pretty sure he does not go to uni either because I never see him get up when I am up and he does an intense course. Help yourself for the love of god!! Stop eating shit and get yourself on a diet you are killing yourself! Oh yeah does not help that he does not clean his fat cover crap just left on the kitchen side.
