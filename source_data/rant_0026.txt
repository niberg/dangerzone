I am not unique

Since joining reddit, I have learned one important thing: My thoughts are not nearly as unique as I originally thought. Almost every post that I view and wish to respond to with some comment has already been commented on with the same thing I wanted to say. I could be happy that I am surrounded by like-minded individuals, but I am more so bummed because I will comment the second thing that comes to mind which is usually something incredibly stupid. I just realized while writing this that someone else has probably already made this post. Oh well, let the down votes flow.
