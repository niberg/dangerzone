Are birthdays the worst day of the year for everyone or just me?

Hey there.

I would like to express some thoughts of mine. Every year, when my birthday comes I start thinking of what I have done all this years and it just becomes depressing and more depressing. 

I wonder how people can actually celebrate their birthdays. I always feel like going to bed very early for the day to pass.
