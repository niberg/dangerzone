TIL That TIL is Mostly Things I Already Know

I feel like 97% of TIL posts are thing that are "Yeah no shit I've known that for years".  Yet these things get up voted like crazy.  Do people just up voted them because they like the thing it's about rather than "oh that's an interesting thing I didn't know"?  TIL makes me feel like one of the most knowledgeable people on Earth.  I wish TIL gave me new and interesting information rather than what seems to be a circle jerk of shit a lot of people already know.
