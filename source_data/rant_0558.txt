Am I really being that unreasonable?! I didn't know having respect for other people was unreasonable.

Before I go on complete rage mode, I need to give a little context to the story. I am a 21 year old female, and a junior in college. I come from a very modest lifestyle, and my family definitely falls into the lower level of the lower class. I am on a full ride scholarship to my school, and I also work a part time job to try and make ends meet. 

My roommate, (20M) is the exact opposite. Let's call him "Rick." Rick comes from super rich parents. And I'm not over exaggerating. They pay for all of his schooling expenses, including tuition, all of his rent and living expenses, including food and other utilities. He has credit cards in his name that they pay for, and to his family, money is "no object." So naturally, my roommate has grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth, and to put it quite bluntly...he's very lazy. At home, his mother does all of his laundry (even folds it and puts it away for him), all of his cleaning (including his room - makes his bed for him, too) and his cooking. And if that wasn't enough, his family has a maid that comes in to clean a couple times a week too. 

***As a disclaimer*** I do not think any of that is inherently wrong. If someone has earned their money, and they are proud of what they make, the lifestyle they choose to live is absolutely none of my business. His parents are super nice people, and I absolutely love them to pieces! In short, rich people are totally cool and I don't have some super negative opinion of people who have money just because I don't have it.

My roommate and I became friends our Freshman year, and this is the first time we've decided to live together. My roommate (knowing how lazy he is) came up with this idea that he, "would pay for all of the groceries if I did the cleaning." At first, I laughed it off, but then he mentioned it again a few weeks later. In my current financial state, the idea of free food for a year? Hellz yeah. ~~He would pay~~ His parents would pay for the food in the apartment, and I would keep the kitchen area and the living room cleaned, which should have been super easy. 

No. It fucking wasn't. 

At most, I thought I'd have to do the dishes every other day, take out the trash when it was full, wipe off counter tops - the usual daily maintenance of living. I was wrong. My roommate took our "deal" and totally took advantage of it. Piling up dishes, without even wiping them off, and then leaving them in his room for days and days before even bringing them out to the sink. Trash piled high before I even got home every night. I know this sounds incredibly exaggerated, but I just spent the past two hours cleaning up the kitchen. I guess I should also mention that out of the 3 months we've been living here, I've only been home maybe half of that time. I normally eat on campus or I go out with friends for dinner, so the amount of food I actually eat at home is substantially lower than I had originally thought when we moved in. 

The real "rage" part of the story, is the fact that my roommate's girlfriend has basically been living here for the past month, rent free. She has a dorm room, but she **literally** has spent the night here every single night. She does her laundry here. She cooks here. She showers here. She essentially lives here. But she doesn't pay rent, chip in on utilities, or do anything (like cleaning) to make up for her being here. My roommate even said, "Well she kinda falls under my stuff" when I mentioned her dishes in the sink. He now expects me to do her dishes in addition to his. I'm not okay with that. 

Financially, this "deal" we've created is beneficial to me. I'm not stupid, I see that. But my problem lies with the fact that he has zero respect for me. Most people have these common courtesies that we do out of respect for other people. Like rinsing off your plate, since someone else is going to clean it for you. (Especially if the person cleaning your plate, is also the one who cooked the food for you in the first place.) Taking out the trash when you're the one who filled it to completion is another example. Or even wiping up a spill you made when pouring yourself a drink. They're not intense "chores," but they make a difference when one person is expected to do *all* of the cleaning for three people. 

I guess, the whole point of this rant, is that I don't think I'm being unreasonable in asking him to rinse of his plates before he puts them in the sink, or to take out the trash every other day when it's full. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to make sure he's cleaned up after his party from the weekend. I don't know. What do you think? 


TLDR; I *think* my roommate is a jerk? We made a "deal" that he'd buy all the food if I cooked and cleaned up after him, but then he included his girlfriend as part of who I'm cooking and cleaning for, and is going above and beyond to make my end of the bargain more difficult.
