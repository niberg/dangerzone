22 Year Old Who's Life Is Already Over

Let me preface by saying before of any of these said things happened I was a generally a very happy person. I have a lighter case of Aspergers, but have a ton of friends, and girlfriends in the past. I'm a huge audiophile, mediaphile, trivia, etc. I read about 200 articles a day, and saw much purpose in life. So, on July 7th I thought I had cough/flu so I took some cough syrup, but puked it up because I have a very weakstomach. This caused me to have esophagitis. Prior to this I hadn't taken any form of medication in 5 years, and I had a general hesitance towards doctors. I don't know what broke my way of thinking that night but I'll always regret it. So, I went to a local patient first where I was promptly prescribed "prilosec", which I would have never blindly took before, but the doctor scared the shit out of me wheb he said I likely have "GERD" syndrome.(which was absolutely not the case, I healed up in 2 weeks and haven't experienced heart burn since). After taking this for 2 days I woke up with a raging headache, which was very alarming because I never had a headache in my entire life. I quit taking it on day 4 because of said side effects. I then waited for said side effects to wear off. On July 17th, I went out with my friends to a party, where I drank some vodca celebrating what I thought was the end of this battle. I drank to intoxication, but not very heavily. I woke up the next day with a pain behind my eye, not intense but constant. "Oh God", not again I thought to myself. So, I went back to the doctor and he assured me it was sinusitis, and then another doctor at another visit said the same thing. They gave me Augmentin. I was very reluctant to take this considering all my bad side effects had occurred before. I didn't take them for about a week , then one i asked my mom if she wanted to see Boyhood by then my mom was agitated with me being sick. Before we left she asked if had taken the augmentin 12 hours ago to keep on schedule. I told her very adamantly that I had been having horrible reactions to all meds I had taken up to that point, and that I just wanted to take a natural way of curing it. She insisted that I had to take to get better, that it would never hurt me to ad nauseam. I eventually suckered in to taking it, thinking "she'll stop yelling and it's really just an antibiotic. Well after I took that I've had a continuous headache everyday since then, it's a condition called NDPH. I wake up to burning pain on both of my temples, and Stabs on the top if my head.  I'll save you the medical information but its a very  hopeless condition. It took awhile to find an "ok" headache specialist who prescribed me a preventive called amitrypline, that has shown practically no success rates of helping this condition. Anitryplyine did nothing to help, but promptly destroyed my perfect memory, mess with cognitive function, and destroy my concentration. Do give you an idea before I was a huge IMBD freak. Yesterday I could remember william shatners name. I'm with drawling from it currently, I did taper, but my memory is not improving. My headache specialist has hope I'll get better, but a month earlier she insisted it was "REACTIVE DEPRESSION". So I don't want to give into any false hope.                                                            So while all of this was going on I got my dream job at a creative agency called Brainwave. We're really small It's run by two heads, one of them actually came up with soda name "Surge" and its Ad campaign. Then there's only me, and one other girl. We do a lot of cool stuff for ad campaigns and are pitching shows, and one of mine for Lifetime we're going to be pitching in two weeks.                                                             Yet none of this makes me happy, I'm in constant pain, my intelligence has been derailed which had caused ego death. No matter how much money I make I'll likely never fix this condition. When I'm not at work I'm locked in my room. I find it hard to see a point to living when I'm going to be in constant pain, while also feeling 10% of my former capabilities. I can't drink, because it will destroy my head. I've sworn if girls because who wants to date someone in constant pain. I have stopped hanging out with friends, because it just depresses me too much seeing young people living their lives care free. I'm extremely infuriated with the doctors who led me down this path, and I wish I would have just listened to my gut, and had never taken that prilosec. Which ultimately brings me to hating myself for ruing my life.I think about suicide all day because my life is hell everyday, from the physical pain, and the extreme mental anguish of how this all happened.  Every day its the same thing over and over. What's the point of being healthy in other aspects where likely ill be in constant pain either way. Also, it's the feeling of being ultimately trapped no matter where I go, I'll always be in constant pain. My parents are devastated, and at times have taken this very poorly, yelling at me that I haven't run this course properly. I could go on and on about how depressing this all is. The only keeping me going is my love of life, and the accomplishments I need to achieve, but every day I breakdown. I got very close today to electrocuting myself. This hell is horrible, and I really don't know what to do. I just want my old brain back, and to feel normal again.
