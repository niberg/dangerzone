Haven't had sex for a year

I haven't sex _for more than a year_, and it's just fucking frustrating right now. I mean, I had almost none sexual experience since my last girlfriend and I broke up. I just want to kiss a girl, hold her head, feel her body, suck on her tits, etc.
But I can't because I'm an idiot, and have a ton of people issues... Eh, fuck, at least I got porn...
