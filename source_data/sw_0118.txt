Help

I feel ignored. Whenever I walk up to a group of friends to socialize most of them don't acknowledge me. Whenever I try to bring up a topic they shut me out. Make me sound stupid. It's really put me down in the dumps lately, making me think no one wants me around. I've had some suicidal thoughts of putting a gun under my head. Really, I'm just looking for advice or ways to avoid these thoughts.
