Why won't it stop?

I have an amazing girlfriend. I have two great kids. I have a decent relationship with their mother. I'm employed with a good job that if I do not screw up,I can basically have forever. I do not do drugs. I am not an alcoholic. I have friends. Why won't my inner battle with wanting to just end it STOP? Yes I've been diagnosed with severe depression,and I've had some therapy,which is nice. Yes I've tried medications,but the ones I've tried have actually amplified my desire to end my life by adding lethargy to the equation. The voice,the thought,the idea...it's been in my head since I was a kid. I love everyone around me,but I feel my existence is a burden. There have been some tough times lately,just in my personal life,that most people can just mow over and move on from. I can't. I have the constant anxiety in the pit if my stomach. I can picture myself doing it. I have plans in my head on how. Not how to IMPROVE my life,but more often than not,how I'm going to end it. My mind won't rest. It's being set off more and more easily lately. I'm at the point where I simply want to cut everyone off,and just DO IT. Why won't it stop??? Why? I have so much good,but my heart and soul are out of fight. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of myself. Why won't my fucking brain let me work,be happy,and move forward. There are certain things that I'm in the middle of right now,that if they do not work,and fighting myself is the hardest part,I will not see 2015. I will not ruin Christmas for everyone,I'll put my happy face on,but if I don't find a bit of a solution...January 1st will be my last day on earth. I need to quiet the pain.
