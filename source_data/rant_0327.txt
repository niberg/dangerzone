Procrastination Is Evil

Procrastination is evil. I found and am selling Pokemon cards from when I was a kid.. The holos are mint, but they only sell well on Ebay if they're graded. The main/best selling service, PSA, has a turn around of 30 business days.. I misread that as 30 days and I've been putting this off since September.

Now there is 0% chance of having these graded in time for when people blow their money for the holidays. I'll either end up selling them for $200-$300 less or getting them graded and the auctions will go for $100-$200 less than if not graded, and the grading service is $100+.

Seeing as I'm not going to be holding on to these things for an entire damn year, I'll have to sell them ungraded. Fuck though.. I had 4 months to do this before. I like to measure these things in terms of coffee. I just threw away 20 kickass coffees.
