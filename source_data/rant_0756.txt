Don't touch the fucking dog.

So I volunteer at a no-kill dog shelter near where I live because I love dogs and want to help them as much as I can. I often have to deal with situations that make me want to hulk smash people into the ocean for numerous reasons such as "Oops I didn't train our puppy properly when we first fucking got him and now I'm scared he will maul our kid now hes a big fucking dog so you guys take him" and "I know we have two kids under four and that its against your policy to give a dog to anyone with young kids but can you make an exception just this once they really want a dog"
and the one that pissed me off today-

"He has a muzzle on why can't I pet him?"

Because we have fucking rules that say no members of the public are to touch any of the dogs whilst they are being walked by volunteers as lots of them hate strange people and dogs. I love volunteering there but people are so fucking stupid when it comes to dogs. WE HAVE FUCKING RULES YOU CAN'T JUST TOUCH THE DOGS WHEN THEY ARE BEING WALKED THAT'S NOT OKAY. I will not let you touch this traumatized dog just because he can't bite you. HE HATES PEOPLE. I will not purposely make him uncomfortable just because you want to pet one of the dogs. Get away from me and the dog. He has a red collar and a muzzle on which means he is currently not up for adoption and has probably bitten someone in the past. Step up or I will fucking take off his muzzle. (I wouldn't really)

Might I add whilst this man was trying to pet him he was growling and hiding behind my legs trying to pull away from me and making my job of walking him a billion times harder because he is now very anxious of a strange man trying to grab him.

Follow the rules like everyone else you douchebag.
