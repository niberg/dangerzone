everyone's gone

i just can't go on anymore, everyday it's gets more painful. everyone has walked out of my life, and i'm alone. i can't stop these thoughts of ending, i feel like my body wants survive and my mind has given up. i don't know who to go to, no one is answering my calls or texts. the walls are close i just have no room to breathe, i feel like a bother to everyone and i don't know what to do. everywhere i look i hear and just see "end it now", i feel like i should just end it now. i'm at my lowest right now, it makes sense to end it. no ones ever been there when i need them and now is the same, i've been trying ti reach out to people i know and nothing. i'm so alone i feel like if someone was there earlier i wouldn't be at this point, i feel like a failure and i should. i was always the loner, just never had a true friend. i just wasn't made for life, life isn't for me. and i've made up my mind i choosing to opt out and just say i've had a good run. i'm all out of ideas i can't keep on, i thought i would never find myself here but i am. i don't know when i'll do it, but when i do i hope no one blames themselves that they could've helped. i can't help myself so it's fine, it's better this way. no one will have to worry about me, or go out of their way to make me feel comfortable. it's just better to end it now. i've had a good life lots of ups and downs and good memories, but i can't go on anymore.
