Had a Bad Week - I'm scared and angry about it

Fuck depression.

This stupid condition is kicking my ass. I've been missing classes and I barely got my medication today. I feel like everyone is sick of me, like I'm dragging down my friends and like I'm going to scare off my girlfriend because I can't be positive when she needs. I feel like a huge fuck up. The new pills aren't helping, either. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Maybe I'll just go back to sleep. I'm so fucking sick of this
