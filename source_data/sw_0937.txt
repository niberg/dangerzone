I don't want to kill myself, I just want to die.

I don't have a future, i don't have any hope of anything good. i make people around me who have worse problems unhappy with my presence. I just want to cut myself off, disappear, make no contact with anyone and die quietly alone of whatever may come. i'm sick of being a waste and i don't know how to fix myself.
