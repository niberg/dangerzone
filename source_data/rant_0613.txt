Too old to be dealing with people like this.

In my late twenties. One of my friends is in between places for the next few weeks and casually asked to stay with me. In my mind I thought well if I was in the same position I would hope I have friends I could stay with, so I agreed. The day my friend is supposed to come over she does not contact me at all that day or keep me updated on her plans. (Nor really the days leading up). At about 8pm i get a text from her that she is getting off work soon can she still stay with me? 

Anyway, the day before the cleaners came to give my apartment a deep cleaning. I mention this to her and let her know its important to me to keep the house clean and please be aware of this. When she comes to my house she goes to the bathroom and starts picking at her skin and popping blemishes. I tell her again please keep things clean and she snaps at me she already knows. She does this for fifteen more minutes then when I go in the bathroom my previously clean mirrors have all these white spots on them.  I tell her and she gets all mad at me and gives me so much attitude saying how rude I am and need to not make such a big deal out of things. 

I wanted her to sleep on the couch while she was here but my roommate was watching tv in the living room. My friend sleeps in bed with me and is coughing and not covering her mouth. Sharing a blanket with me. My roommate is being loud and the coughing is bugging me so I can't really sleep and I'm looking at my phone. My friend says she can't sleep bc of me. I tell her she should go sleep on the couch then bc my roommate is done watching tv. She starts saying how rude I am and how rude it is I am making her sleep on the couch.  

She hasn't said thank you or anything remotely considerate or acknowledging how she might be imposing on others. Her whole attitude is so entitled and lacks self awareness. It's incredible. So annoyed.
