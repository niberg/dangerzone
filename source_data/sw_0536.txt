This almost certainly wont work but i have an idea to try and help myself

It wont. I'll get anxiety when I go to do anything more that likley. But I used to go skiing in  high school. I haven't skied for several years. I'm not good at it or anything, but I did go a lot because I belonged to this club. 

  It just came into my head to get some ski gear and start going again. (At the time I was a different girl. I still got sad and even took an overdose around that time. But I didn't stay unhappy. I just reacted strongly to things. -- but the point was when I skied - like when I swam underwater - I felt insulated and free at the same time. You know how the snow muffles sound?

 I skied at night because that's when this high school club took us on a bus. But it was so wild being up on these hills with the stars and the wind and flying down these hills. And I'm so depressed right now, and suicidal all the  time. Stuff has happened - doesn't matter what right now. 

Or I could cross country, which I've never done, but I would like being in the woods. I'd get stronger. Because it's f'ing hard. But maybe I need someone to kick me in the ass - but I don't have someone to do that. So maybe I can kick myself in the ass and sweat all this f##@ up pain and shit in my head out. 

The other option is to drown myself or hang myself or something. I've thougth a lot about those 2 things. Mostly the first one. In a way I've given myself till Christmastime to decide. Don't know, I will probably chicken out like I do a lot now.(about skiing I mean)  But maybe I can be disciplined, make goals and keep track of things. Focus on achieving marker points in skiing. I obviously can't do that forever. It's not like I can make a career of it. But sometimes I feel like there is a glass wall in front of me and if i  can just smash through it. 

Jesus. Or maybe I"m full of shit. I jsut had a little burst of energy and wanted to write this here. thanks and sorry it's so long and meandering.
