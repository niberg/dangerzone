I don't want to be alive but I feel like I have no choice

I really just don't care I made a recovery from a major depressive episode a while ago but what am I supposed to do now everyone is happy that I'm still alive but how am I supposed to live I still have no motivation everything is so annoying and troublesome there just no point I can't get anything done and I don't want to be here but how can I kill myself now that people know I have clinical depression everyone will be so sad not that they ever did much for me sure they care and all that but they only want to help when it's convenient for them they don't really care about me and neither do I really whats the point of this why am I still alive
