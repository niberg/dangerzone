I give up SW. I'm sorry.

I'm really tired, I tried somewhat. I'm 17, i'm a Junior in HS. I'm fucking done. I don't care if it gets better i'm done. I'm ugly as fuck, i'm awkward as fuck. I'm fucking obese. So it's either do by some health condition or fucking kill myself. Life doesn't seem worth it and I give up. I don't fit in anywhere. All the communities I thought I were a part of? Nope. They are fucking awful. Gaming is awful, music is awful. Everything is awful. Whenever something 'good' happens, I get fucked over. I have access to some lethal pills, just I don't have enough. I'm waiting for the right time and opportunity to get more. Or if not OD, hang myself. I give up SW. Sorry.
