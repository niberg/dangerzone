You serve 4 soups every day and there hasn't been clam chowder in a week FUCK THIS

Nobody wants to eat italian wedding shit, chicken noodle, tomato, minestrone, or really bad chilli. We just want clam chowder. Everytime there is clam chowder it is always the only soup bowl that gets empty. It is the only soup that causes a line to form.
