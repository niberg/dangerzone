Fuck windows update and fucking acer npflify

Four years ago I bought a 600€ fucking Acer Notebook, I never used that shit, only used it to write little short stories and watch movies in bed. I never connencted it to the internet, because we didn't have fucking wlan. One week ago we got us some wlan, finally, and I start using that four year old notebook for university, because it's pretty handy. But that thing wasn't connected to the internet for four whole years and now it wants to do hundreds of fucking windows updates at once, so I let it. And after two hours of letting it update, it decides to crash, tries to revert everything, everything goes to shits, system recovery does nothing, bluescreen on every startup, had to reinstall fucking windows, took almost the whole day. Finally it's all done and ready, but fucking wlan doesn't work, because the fucking drivers for fucking acer fucking nplify won't install correctly. Now I've got a 600€ acer notebook I can't do shit with that cost me hours of my fucking life I'm never getting back. Now I've got to make time to go buy a new notebook, waste some more fucking hundreds of €s on it, just to wait until that shit starts having issues as well. 
You fuck.
