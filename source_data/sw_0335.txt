Please help me. I doubt I'll be making it to the end of the week.

I don't know where to start. I literally disgust myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. This past weekend I went away with some friends to party and like always I couldn't control myself. I got hammered and called up this girl I've been in love with and told her how I felt. She rejected me and literally told me,"You need to let this die." So that happened. Then I got propositioned for a threesome. I chickened out halfway because I felt so gross. So now I'm probably pregnant (I'm a girl) or have aids or something.

I really have no reason to live. The love of my life rejected me. I have a drinking problem. I feel and am disgusting. I'm just so depressed. I quit my antidepressants because they weren't working. Nothing can save me. Please, please can someone help me? I'm so scared. I'm so sad. I'm literally at rock bottom. I've struggled with depression for a long time but it's never been this bad. 

I'd rather kill myself than deal with how shitty my life is. I'll be honest and say that I'm 100% serious about going through with it.
