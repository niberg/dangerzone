The greatest enemy of our time is ignorance, and I feel we're losing the war.

Almost all the problems that I see in the world can be traced back to the ignorance of the population.

Corruption &lt;--- Taking of Power &lt;--- People not understanding power &lt;--- Apathy and ignorance

War &lt;--- Religion &lt;--- Belief without Evidence &lt;--- Ignorance

Hate &lt;--- Ignorance

Environmental Destruction &lt;--- Ignorance

...

People seem to be generally getting dumber, outside very small pockets of enlightened individuals.

It makes me sad and sick at the same time when I see that there are still ignorant people out there causing unnecessary pain and suffering in the world. When there are ignorant people leading civilization on a collision course to it's own demise.

When will the stupidity end? This is really awful.
