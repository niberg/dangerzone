Teenagers suck.

I'm a teenager. My friends and most the people around me are teenagers. 

I have come to the realization that teenagers are horrible people. The characteristics of everyone around me are disgusting and its not much fun being around them.

Everyone is just trying at 110% effort to fit in and it means that they are constantly edgy, rude, selfish, absorbed into other peoples lives, show-offs, attention seekers, sheep, and damn right annoying. 

Guys. Girls. Fellow teenagers. Chill the fuck out.

Its unpleasant being around you people I wish you would have some more self-esteem and just be yourselves!!!!

End of rant :)
