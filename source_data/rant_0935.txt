Ebola and Conspiratards

EBOLA IS NOT A PLOT BY OBAMA. GET THAT SHIT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULLS.

Firstly, the history of ebola dates back to 1976, well before Obama was president. Secondly, I've heard from Conspiratards that Obama wants to infect America with it as payback for slavery. This is ridiculous on its face, but also if that were true, why would it be in Liberia, a country founded by freed slaves?!

Also, when I look up Ebola on YouTube, 8 out of the 10 first results are from Alex Jones, king of conspiratards everywhere. Fuck him, and fuck anyone who says ebola is a conspiracy. If you think it is, I hope you contract it and I hope the blood rushing out your ass acts as an enema for all the shit you are full of.
