Just because I'm not good at math doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to attend a good college

I'm in my Junior year of High School and I'm fucked. I've never been good at math, I want to do music math isn't important to me. But because I get D's in math and A's in everything else my GPA is to low to enter a good college. I want to be a music major, why do I have to know all this advanced math? School's preach that they want the teen suicide rate lower. What leads to suicide? In most cases depression. What leads to depression? In most cases stress. Having to take a hard math class puts so much stress on me, not getting into a good college makes me depressed. I'm just one step away from stepping to far and killing myself and what does the school system do? Here take trig. I'm fucked
