My damn article isn't opinionated.

Ok I wrote a fucking article on signs of depression and ways to cope with the bad thoughts and shit like exercise 'cause it can improve your mood. Of course I mentioned that self-harm WAS NOT a good way to deal with depression thoughts, I said it was bad, and gave alternatives such as ice cube in hand and screaming and punching a pillow. Counselors won't let it go through though, so my article this issue is out...
