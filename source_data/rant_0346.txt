I Always Screw Up On My Exams

I started well ahead of time. Worked out 400 fucking problems for a basic linear algebra test. Make ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION errors during matrix reduction. Lose 8 points for this and score 1 point below the average on my v easy midterm (went from what would be a 47/50 to a 39/50). I want to go to graduate school in a quantitative field, but what the fuck can I do if I keep screwing up basic classes? I try and work 50x harder and make stupid ass mistakes like this. Today forgot calculator for Ochem midterm, and just gave up on solving a log problem because of that...I need good grades to get into an engineering major by this year. What the fucking hell am I doing!?!
