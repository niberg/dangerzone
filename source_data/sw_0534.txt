The difference between actively suiciding and passively allowing yourself to die?

If someone were to simply surrender to their own physical flaws/faults and allow him or herself to die, would a physician be allowed to commit that person against his or her will? Like, say someone is diabetic and chooses to take no action to solve the problem and just let the disease consume him or her until death. Can a doctor force that person into involuntarily commitment because he or she poses a threat to him or herself?

...I feel the need to point out that I am asking this question with complete sincerity.
