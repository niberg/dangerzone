The Maze Runner rant (Spoilers)

So I just saw the Maze Runner and it wasn't terrible but it was pretty tropey. You had your lead who hadn't done anything at that point but just by looking at the entrance to the maze was deemed, "Not like anyone else," and "special". Oh and then you had your guy in the group that immediately disliked the protagonist because plot convenience (though he did have some very good points), and the kid who forms a sibling type bond with the main but dies in the end. Oh and they even had some nice foreshadowing with him where he asks the main to give him this statuette to his parents but the main says, "No, you'll give it to them yourself." And then of course he dies right as they are about to get out and gives him the statuette anyways.

But the worst part to me was the shoed in "romantic" interest. She literally added nothing to the plot. They made it seem like she was a huge fucking deal in the trailer but she pretty much did nothing except bring plot development items. Seriously they could've just put those in the elevator and it would've had the same outcome. They didn't even really explore the ZOMG IT'S A GURL angle. Oh but she and the main have this connection because they knew each other but they don't remember that. Which I guess makes it okay to introduce her into the plot. Seriously I'm all for this movie not being a total sausage fest but at least have the female lead actually work as a character in her own right. The evil scientist had way more development than she did and she only got a fraction of the screen time. Oh and the evil corporation is called WCKD pronounced "Wicked".


...^(The effects were nice though)
