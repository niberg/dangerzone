White privilege? What about all the other "privileges"?

I gotta admit, talk about white privilege annoys me. I don't think it's a useful concept. Pretty much everyone where I live is white. Even if I wanted to discriminate, I'd have a hard time finding someone of a racial minority to be an asshole to. But those who push white privilege think it's important for all whiteys, everywhere, to acknowledge.

I get why other people think it's important, but something about the vibe just rubs me the wrong way. Life is easier when you're white; I get that. But life is also easier when you're not born poor, with a disability, or in a third-world country. I'm happy to not have AIDS or some other terrible disease. I'm also glad I didn't get hit by a bus yesterday.

You might say, "Well, those aren't fair analogies bikebum." Sure they are. Me being white doesn't make it any harder for non-white people to do their thing. Sure, it's possible that my ancestors treated their ancestors like crap, and that sucks. But nothing I am doing today is keeping anybody down. Just like me not getting hit by a bus doesn't mean someone else is gonna get hit by it instead.

People push the white privilege idea because they want whiteys to understand they don't know what it's like to be non-white and have some compassion. That's a good cause, but there is a much better reason: cause it's the fuckin' right way to be! We should always remember we don't know what it's like to be anybody but ourselves, and treat others with respect and equality. You don't need any liberal, pseudo-academic ideas for that. Like how you don't need a religion to act morally (rant for another time?).

It sucks way harder to live in an extremely poor country than it does to be ANYBODY in the U.S. If you want to promote equality, shut up about white privilege and donate some money to fight world poverty (check out http://thelifeyoucansave.org/). Or just do the second and be less pretentious about the first.
