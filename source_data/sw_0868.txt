Considering committing to commit... Everything is lost.

You know what the shittiest thing about depression/anxiety. That no matter what good is in your life, your brain will find a way to make you feel like a piece of shit who deserves to die.

I hate it... It's ruining personal and professional relationships... and I'm exhausted from it. 

Been going to a counselor but it's really just a firing range of emotions and thoughts but I still feel constricted from sharing everything that is wrong. What happens when you have too much emotional ammunition and you cannot expend it all? 

This is probably a stupid post.... like everything I do whenever I try to reach out.
