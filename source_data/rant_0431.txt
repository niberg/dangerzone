MCAT rant...I don't know where else to put this...

(possibly the first of many)

I'm fucking tired of busting my ass night after night after a full day of work and waking up at 5:30 in the gad damn morning just to hear about some random chica who got into DO School with a FUCKING 19. I SHIT YOU FUCKING NOT. and I'm not hating, I'm not even jealous I'm just so fucking angry because oh my fucking God all i've done for the past three months is study and and I'm trying to get a 30 and how DARE this woman write a sparkly pink blog about how she got in with a 19. 

AND NOT have the fucking HEART to at least tell us that ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO JUST "GET IN" WITH A 19. who the fuck gets a 19 and still even applies?! maybe I'm just fucking disillusioned but this is my second time taking the MCAT and I KNOW that it takes more than that. This woman probably had a fucking STELLAR PS and ECs with LORs from Jesus and Mother Mary themselves but just wants to sit there like "I got a 19...anything's possible!"

Shut up. You're not a success story, you're a gaddamn outlier.

((disclaimer: I probably don't mean any of this...there's just a lot of aggression going on...my test is in two weeks...SDN is a bitch filled with perfect people who still have the audacity to ask "what are my chances" and if you understand all this lingo, then thank you ))
