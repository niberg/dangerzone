Landed in the hospital.

I almost succeeded in killing myself two days ago. But fate for some reason didn't want me to die that day. My friend showed up to my house not too long after I took pills and she called the ambulance. Was I wrong all along? Do people actually care? It's been drilled into my head for so long I fail to see whats reality and what's all in my head. I'm still messed up after my ex boyfriend raping me, but I feel now as though it happened for a reason... maybe I was supposed to go through with that so my friend could save me? I don't know. All I know is that I'm here another day, but I still feel numb. Can life really get better? Because I'm not sure if I can let my hopes be broken again. I want to live to be able to raise a child that knows I love them and I know they're safe. I want to live knowing I can try to put this stuff behind me. Can i? I'm not sure yet....
