Drunk drivers...

Drunk driver,

A few years ago I had one of the best people I have ever met taken away from me by another like you. 

Today, I get to add two more people to the list. Two people I have never met also died in the car crash. You and another are in critical condition. 

$20.
Twenty dollars is what it would have cost you to be safe last night.
$20. 

4 people died last night for $20. Years ago, I lost a love for $20. 

Everything they could have been, everything they could have done, every last thing they worked for is now worth $20. 

When you recover, I hope every time you open your wallet and and reach for a twenty, you think to yourself this movie, or book, or dinner is worth the same as your 4 (possibly 5) friends lives. Every fucking time. Because I sure do. 

May your nights be full of terrors.

To everyone else, 

Just before you get in a car with a drunk driver, are about to let someone become drunk driver, or become a drunk driver yourself, kindly stop and take $20 out of your wallet.

Now and stuff it down your godamn throat and choke on it you fucking cunt. 

Cheers,
