It's going to end soon.

I have lived for almost 18 years and I have seen and felt enough to make conclusions about life, and these conclusions led me to decision that I shouldn't live anymore. I'll try to present that conclusions here.

First conclusion is the fact that life is hard. Crazy hard. I'm just in high school, yet I'm already can't take anymore of it. I just can't learn all that math/CS/linguistics I need to pass final exams that quickly, and if I fail any of them, my life will be even worse than it is now. It's even worse when you can't interact with people and have nobody to share your interests with. 

And even if I won't fail them, I'll have to study even harder at a college, living in a dorm with different people (one of my worst fears). Oh, and after that comes the reason why I spent a fucking quarter of my life learning useless junk: I'll be doing boring, tedious work for the rest of my life. 

Second conclusion is that people will do a lot of terrible stuff to you. I still remember, for example, how I was fighting off doctor trying to put me under anesthesia when I was six.  I still remember waking up from it, knowing that part of me has been destroyed forever. I hated myself since I was forcefully circumcised and I will hate myself until I die. I know it sound silly, but it's actually huge problem for me. I'm happy for you if you feel OK with part of your dick being cut off forcefully. I don't feel that way. 

The third conclusion is that if you can't communicate with people easily, you are worthless. I guess it's so obvious that it shouldn't be explained. 

I will kill myself soon. Life doesn't worth living and I'm better off dead anyway. Thanks for reading this post.
