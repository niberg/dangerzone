Fuck Smokers.

I work for a manufacturing plant, it's a rather large warehouse with bay doors and all that jazz, and A LOT of people I work with smoke, at least 80% of them (including my Supervisor).


I'm not sure about some places in the world, but it's illegal to smoke indoors in my area. But y'know what these fuckers are doing?


**THEY'RE ALL FUCKING SMOKING INDOORS!!!**


Not only is it fucking ILLEGAL, it's fucking disgusting! I hate the smell of cigarettes, but there's ten people sitting at a table inside the fucking warehouse smoking on breaks. There are a plentiful amount of doors to choose to GO OUT-FUCKING-SIDE, and they still smoke inside.


It's also not even cold! They've been doing this since the middle of the fucking summer! I go outside at every break to my charge my phone in my car, and when I come back in, the place just reeks of cigarettes for a good hour, it's so fucking disgusting.


And the fact that my supervisor does it, I can't say shit because he's part of the fucking problem! And the owner knows this is happening too because he'll be in the back while this is happening.


I'm just so fucking sick of the foul smell, the second hand smoke and the fact that the only way to make this situation change is to essentially call the labour board on my employer. 


Seriously, fuck smokers. Have some fucking respect and don't force your chemicals down my god damn throat.
