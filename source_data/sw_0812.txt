I don't know where to post this.

Hi

It's been a long emotional night. I don't know where to post this sorry. I just really want some help.

So last year, my freshman year of high school, November 17th, 2013, to be exact, my town was destroyed by a tornado. Unfortunately for me, I had not one house but TWO houses destroyed by the tornado. I was moving from one house to the next and the tornado happened to hit both. What are the odds?! Anyway, tonight I was with my friends and we are talking about dreams. My friend told us that she has recurring nightmares about a creepy thing in her house. I can relate. I have recurring dreams about the day of the tornado. I specifically remember being in the dream in my basement, it's pitch black and all I can hear is the sirens going off and the rumbling of the house as its being destroyed. The next part is what I saw coming out of it. Some apartments across my yard got directly hit and the shear terror I had from that is absolutely terrible. The final part of the dream is walking down the street. I can't hear anything but the sirens still going off. It's like a scene from a movie where the main character is surrounded by chaos and he is casually and calmly walking through it while he just soaks it all in.

The siren absolutely terrifies me. It's been so long since that day and yet I STILL can't get over that sound.

Back to reality-

I broke down crying in a Stake and Shake after talking about the tornado.

Even though our house is rebuilt I still haven't gotten over the things I lost and am still petrified at the sound of the sirens.

What should I do?
