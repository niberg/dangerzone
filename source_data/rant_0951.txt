Fucking Union busting and Koch brothers.

I fucking work at General Motors as a temporary employee. I've been a temporary employee for almost 3 years. No lay offs. Temporary. A lot of people I work with blame the unions because it's their job. True. But how did this happen? Oh right. The Koch brothers bribing politicians to pass 1% beneficial legislation. Seriously. What the fuck. Power is messed up. Now I get why Dumbledore didn't want to be the minister of magic. My cat is named albus. Anyways, what the fuck. Three years without a day off. No benefits. No vacation. While working next to people doing the same job making double what I make (plus all of the benefits).

I can hear right wing people saying "oh, if you don't like it find another job." Like it's that easy. It's not. I live in Michigan. You come here and find a job paying $15 an hour. Even that isn't enough to work on getting ahead. I don't know how people do it on less. Probably by living a shitty life and ignoring personal happiness. I have a baby on the way so security is really something that I need. I need a job I can continue to go to every day to feed my kid and take care of my girlfriend.at the same time I need to save up for retirement for myself and put away some money for schooling for my daughter. I'm financially okay but the absence of a job looming over my head sucks. And this is the way it's going to be pretty much for the rest of my life. 

I accept it. I just don't understand why these CEOs and corporate hedge fund guys just fuck is. No minimum wage. No added inflation. No mandatory healthcare. Nothing that would benefit the bottom 90% of Americans. This country disgusts me. We put business achievements ahead of individual sustainability and livelihood. Fuck Scott walker, fuck Rick Snyder, fuck mitt Romney, kind of fuck Obama but he did help get me a job with the auto bailout. So I guess that's something. Thanks Obama.
