I miss her so much.

Hi. Let me start off with, I'm very shy and we go to different schools. 
   I met her in the summer of this year. We were both going into High school. I had a crush on her the day we started talking. We flirted and checked on each other constantly. We went to the movies together a couple of times. I loved her so much. The only problem was, she was going to a different school than I was. We texted everyday when school started back up. I loved talking to her and she loved talk to me (she tells me this a lot). Eventually, I told her I loved her. She said that she had a huge crush on me. We sorta started dating. We officially started dating about 3 weeks after this. The only problem was that we went to different schools and could only see each other at the movies. I was hesitant on asking her on a date. We broke up a couple days later. As I said before, I'm shy and I don't know any girls, much less can talk to them without embarrassing myself. I miss her. It hurts so much. She doesn't like to talk to me as much. I still love her.....
Help me..
