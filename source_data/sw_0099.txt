Whats the point of living? Because I could really use a reason right now.

Words can't describe how tired I am of being depressed. Im so tired of waking up to the same meaningless existence and having no hope for a better tomorrow that I've actually reached the point where I'm tired of being tired (if that makes any sense). How can someone who is so deeply defined by their past hope to amount to anything more in the future than just another broken stranger you see on the sidewalk. I can't find joy anymore and scarier still, I've stopped caring about whether I find it or not. Theres nothing that makes me come alive. At one point I thought it was music, but after I completely screwed up college last year, that dream just went down the drain. Is there any chance of redemption? Is there really a place in the world for someone like me? Because for as far back as I can remember...I've been purposeless.
