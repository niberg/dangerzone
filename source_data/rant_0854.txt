Hey, Walgreens: FUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU!

I'll preface this little rant with a dislaimer: I'm only pissed off at the people who make corporate policy. NOT the people who staff individual stores.

So, a few stores did something stupid, and now the DEA is crawling up your company's ass. Great. And you need to placate them somehow. Ok.

But can someone please explain the rational behind the decision to NOT fill prescriptions for someone if they have certain combinations. Combinations like pain killers and muscle relaxers?  What was the logic behind this?! "Oh, no one has deep muscle injuries that cause chronic pain, who needs those medicines?"

Way to go chucklefucks. Now the entire city is out of Lortab. Well, except for Walgreens, since they'll only fill prescriptions for people who are *only* on Lortab. My mother, the nurse who tore the muscles in her back lifting patients, has to go *at least* week without her pain killers because you twatscabs decided to overcompensate for a fuck up.

There are Doctor's offices in this city that are refusing to even write prescriptions for your stores, because of all the Bull Shit their patients would have to go through.

I hope you douche canoes tear your fucking Obliques so you can live in the same hell you've damned your customers.
