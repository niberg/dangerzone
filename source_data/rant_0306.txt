I thought we had a 0 tolerance for bullying in school!

A new year means a whole new set of classes here at my high school. And because of the high schools combining here, there's a whole new batch of kids as well. It's been an exciting thing, seeing all these kids you thought you'd never see again. I always try to talk to my best friend that I've had since 2nd grade. I love my classes and everything; I'm even in a vocational school for half the day.

However, there is one thing I dread. My last period, American Sign Language. Of course, being an English language course, a lot of people without intention of actually *going* with this as a career or anything. So here comes all the trash our school has to offer. There is a specific group in my period I have to hear every day. It's a group of 3 Junior boys (3rd year high school, in case anyone out there doesn't know).

At first, they all sat next to each other. That's where it started. The "leader" of the group started it. In a small argument between him and this other girl about whether a white lion exists, he lost and called her a slut, made fun of the gap in her teeth, and kept calling her other names. He didn't stop. Even a day after he was still making fun of her. Calling her names. The weekend finally put a stop to it.

I approached this girl before class one day and asked if she was alright. She said she was, but I can't be totally sure about that. She seemed different. She was definitely a victim of bullying. 

That was the start of me feeling uncomfortable in that class. That was almost a month ago.

Almost every day, the "leader" of that group of boys swears loudly or disrupts the class by saying a certain phrase that's not supposed to be said. I don't want to say it either; it's not that it's horrible, I'm just honestly afraid he's going to find out about this.

Anyways, I made friends with the guy I sat next to. For the sake of the story, let's call him Kade. So Kade and I stayed after class to let the teacher know about how bad he's been. She has partial hearing loss, so she doesn't always hear what happens, especially when there's other noises happening. 

Anyway, Kade and I let her know that there's some slander happening in her class. She tells us to keep an eye on it for her and tell her about it later. We agree and head home. The next day, everyone is moved around and Kade and I are moved next to each other right next to the problem kid. We don't stay after for a week so we don't call attention to ourselves. In the midst of that silence, I go and speak with the school counselor about the kid. He's a **huge** issue that our school has and he's been hear about plenty of times. So I talk to my counselor there to see if there was anything he could do. 

"You sound like you're treating this issue like a 10," he tells me, talking about the scale of intensity of issues. "You should treat it more like a 5." 

I had thought that I could talk to him, but he seems to not be helping. I smile and nod and say "Okay", just so he thinks I'm listening to him and I can get out of there quicker. His advice doesn't help, even when I told him about what the kid was calling that girl. I didn't think about it at the time, but I probably should have mentioned the "Zero Tolerance for Bullying!" rule our school has. 
The counselor tells me to have a word with the teacher again with Kade and it will solve things. Then go talk with an administrator if things aren't solved.

I'm not a guy who can do something right away. So I sat around planning it for a few days. After a little while, I try to skip out on class by going to the office to try to speak with an administrator before I talked to her. I hate lying, so I told the secretary what my counselor said and she said just to go talk to the teacher first. Plan failed.

I tell Kade when I get back to class and he's like, "Let's go dude, let's take care of this." He seemed to have his own idea. That's great, actually. So that day we talked to her again.

She seemed shocked. I told her about me trying to go to the office. She took us both there ourselves and took us directly to the guy that would care. So Kade, the teacher, and I all talked to the administrator. He said he'd take it to our principle and make sure something is done about it. 

It's been almost a week now, and nothing's happened. The same bull happens each day in class and I end up being more and more uncomfortable with going each day. To the point where I plan on being late just so I don't have to deal with a full our of him, more like 50 minutes. It's a good little break, but I'm always uncomfortable going in there every day. I think about it all day and dread it. 

And a question just came into my mind again. "What happened to the zero tolerance for bullying at school?" My counselor should have done something right away instead of telling me that I'm overreacting. The administrator should have gotten it fixed right away instead of waiting and not doing anything. (And I understand that there may be some huge things happening behind the scenes, but this isn't something that you can sweep under the rug. Lives might be at stake.)

**TL;DR: A kid in my school is bullying and none of the administrators are doing anything about it.**

**EDIT:** I didn't realize that steaks were tastier than stakes.
