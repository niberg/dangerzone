I need someone to talk to. Can't be alone.

I'm 22. I recently got out of a long term relationship. I moved out of our place and am now staying with my physically abusive father (not always, just enough to make it hard to feel safe here). My closest friend has a worse home life so I can't stay with her.

I really want to do my hair, put on my favourite dress and cut my wrists in the tub. I can't find sharp knives. What am I meant to do. I'm confused. I don't want my parents to find me but I don't know what other options I can try without traumatizing someone. I wish I could go in a car crash so no one could blame me for it.

I just want someone to give me advice or something please, I can't talk to my loved ones about this. My dad doesn't think I should go on anti-depressants, and last time I went on them these thoughts only got worse. Not sure what to do. Don't want to die, just don't want to be around.
