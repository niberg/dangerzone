when to stop fighting

I have been battling depressing a most of my life.  I can say that i have been depressed since 8 years of age, when i first tried to kill myself.  I am going to be 32 next week and just don't have it in me anymore.  I am on antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and talk therapy and although i can sometimes live with a facade of optimism, deep down I just feel like this is not worth it anymore.  
I was sexually abused as a little girl and yes, I have intimacy issues.  I trust very few people even though I really want to.  The people i have trusted have let me down in the end, including my own sisters and the man I married.  I realized after having to ask him to touch me and comfort me that I was so desperate for someone to give a shit about me, because i haven't really had that in my life.  and it really hasn't worked for me. I asked for a divorce but i wanted him to to try to fight for this, but he just wasn't that into me.
And i am trying to find something to look forward to so i don't just quit, but at the moment, i feel just overwhelmed. Right now I am just doing ideation which feels really good and is helping me, but i am tired of being alone.  
I don't have children, I am very replaceable at my job, and I lack friends.  My husband would take the cat, and i think my therapist will be the only one to miss me (since I pay her).  My youngest sister will miss me, but i can make her the beneficiary of my small life insurance plan.  then she can pay for nursing school and go full time.  That is the small way I think i can matter anyway.
