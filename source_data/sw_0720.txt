I've gotten bad again

Incoming: Wall of text!
I've kind of had a fluctuating "depression" (never actually been to a professional, I don't know if it actually is depression) for about 3 years. I went about 4 months feeling okay (which was definitely a new feeling), then I went downhill from there. I can't do anything anymore. I can't speak to my friends right. I can't get out of bed in the morning. I can't get my homework done. I can barely even think. I can't fucking feel anything besides anger and disappointment.  Nothing feels real to me anymore.

Long story short, this whole "living" thing isn't working out too well for me. Professional help isn't really an option for me. I feel like if I ended it, my family would be better off in the long run. Speaking of family, I've tried to talk to my mom about all this but she is very religious; I'm not. Her only solution for me is to pray and "think good thoughts; you're thinking too negatively." She thinks any treatment besides the good ol' Jesus Christ is poisoning my mind (medication or no medication)

I don't see where else I have to turn. I feel so trapped and I want to fucking scream and I feel like the only way I could ever get real help is by attempting suicide. I want to get be better but I can't and I want to die and I don't know what to do anymore. Sorry for rambling so much.
