How can a family forget your wedding anniversary

My husband and I have been married for 6 years now . And every year we celebrate everyone's birthday and anniversary in his family and every year my birthday and our anniversary are forgotten. It really pisses me off. Don't get me wrong there past 3 years they have an excuse for not celebrating my birthday because our daughters birthday is a well after mine but damn to not even acknowledge our anniversary after having to go to all of there family celebrating pisses me off.  Oh well rant over.
