To the narcissists

Man.. Seems like we live in a very narcissistic society/generation. Everybody bragging and shoving it into peoples faces. I got something to say to those people. Fuck you. No one cares. You're human just like us, whatever you do, many others can probably do it too. And how about trying to be selfless and caring for once. Maybe then we can have a peaceful and selfless generation
