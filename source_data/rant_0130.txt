My dad is the most stubborn piece of shit

Long story short, we have some internet problems at the house, and need to reset the modem. In resetting it, it's asking me for a password to an email that was set years and years ago, and none of us remember. No problem, I call the customer service people, explain the issue, and the guy pushes me through the process in under 2 minutes.

Dad is in the other room, calling the same customer service. I can barely hear the guy I'm calling because he won't stop yelling about the most trivial bullshit. I walk in there and tell him I resolved the problem on my own. He's screaming at this poor woman about how the e-mail account, which was set up a long time ago, is in my mom's name (they're divorced now) and how it should be in his. Mind you, this is an e-mail no one *actually uses*, just the default e-mail you get when signing up at the ISP. It is in no way connected to billing or anything like that and therefore *doesn't actually matter even a little bit.* It's so inconsequential that neither I or my dad even knew this was the case until tonight, nearly 8 years after initially setting up the service.

Of course most people would understand this isn't a big deal, and I try explaining it to him. He goes off on a rant about customer service technicians and some other call center issue he's decided in his mind to write off as crap. I can't fucking stand this kind of close-mindedness, and we ended up getting into a very loud argument over something that should have been resolved in under 5 minutes.

What bothers me the most is that he's not even that foreign to technology, he works with this kind of stuff all day long, it's just the way he treats people he has no connection to that infuriates me. 

Dad, you're a stubborn asshole towards everyone trying to help you, and frankly it's embarrassing to even be associated with you and your temper tantrums. Fucking done.
