Came to rant. Didn't. Still felt good.

So this isn't really a rant but I had to say that coming over to /r/rant and typing up a huge piece about why I hate women in the marine corps. Almost posting it. Then deleted it. Actually felt good. Like really fucking good. 
Thank you rant for helping me expel a lot of frustration. 

If you're Butthurt that I hate females in the marine corps... Well fuck you I don't care. Maybe you should tell em to meet the fucking standards.
