I'm not worthless...

My worth is __negative__. [insert "what a twist" joke here]

I've been nothing but a drag on my family for the whole fifteen-odd years that I've lived. I estimate that my family has spent a total of approximately $1 million on me, and what did I give back? Nothing. Null. Nada. Zilch. Zero. 10 to the negative fucking infinity. Does that not imply my net worth is -$1000000?! It does. And everyone who thinks otherwise is delusional. I'm also a burden on my family in other ways. For example, I am a failing student, having failed 2 of the 10-odd subjects that the school system forces me to study. Both my parents had ___straight A's in every fucking subject! AND SINCE I CAN'T PERFORM ACADEMICALLY AS WELL AS THEY DID, WHAT AM I OTHER THAN A BURDEN, A BAD SON AND A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING?!___

Y'all are lucky that I don't have anything to end myself with within 10 meters of me, otherwise I would've already ended it all and made the world a better fucking place by ridding it of myself.
