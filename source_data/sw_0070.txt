Feel hopeless, why should I go on?

As I am typing this it is 3 in the morning and I have been rolling around in bed for the past 3 hours crying and thinking about ending it all. I am a senior in college, this semester has been absolutely terrible. I haven't been going to classes and my grades are suffering a ton. This isn't the first time this has happened, last year I got kicked out for a semester because my grades were bad and I wasn't going to class enough to change them. I found out I got kicked out and it took me about 10 days to work up the courage to tell my parents. They were supportive and helped me get through it and eventually back into school, but I knew on the inside they were just thinking about how much of a screwup I am. I got back into school this semester and it has just been going downhill and now I am at the point where I feel trapped and there is no hope. I don't know what to do, I feel there is a good chance that I won't be able to get good enough grades to stay in, and I sit here in bed everynight thinking how much of a screwup I am. If I get kicked out I will be over 30k in debt from student loans with no job. I feel like just laying in bed all day and never doing anything. I have no money to do anything fun, go out with friends or anything. I feel hopeless and I can not see any good coming of my life. I can't stop thinking about the day when I find out I am kicked out for good, I don't think there will be anything keeping me from ending it.
