I'm so fucking sick of having teeth extracted! AUGH!!

On Friday I have to have my wisdom teeth taken out, they're so far back that I can't reach them to clean, and my dentist can't even reach them to clean, so they're coming out to avoid them rotting out of my skull, and I was looking forward to *actually* being out for fucking once to have my teeth out, but NOPE! Dream ruined!


Ever since I was a kid, I had issues with crowding. My mouth was too small to accommodate the normal amount of teeth, so I had to have some pulled to make room and so I could have braces. DO YOU HAVE ANY FUCKING CLUE HOW MUCH IT SUCKS TO HAVE TEETH PULLED!? I've had two baby teeth removed that wouldn't come out on their own, and **FOUR-SIX FUCKING ADULT TEETH!** (I honestly can't remember exactly how many adult teeth I've had out, it's been a good six or seven years...)

It's gotten to the point now where I need **FIVE OR MORE FUCKING NEEDLES** one one side alone just so I can't feel my fucking dentist yanking god damn calcium out of my fucking face. It is so fucking uncomfortable to have two sets of hands yanking on your cheeks, pulling on your mouth, the freezing tastes *awful* (I DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF YOU SAY IT TASTES LIKE CHERRIES, BECAUSE IT REALLY JUST FUCKING DOESN'T!!!) and after two needles, your mouth just feels like mother fucking shit BUT GUESS WHAT! Here comes three more so you don't bawl your fucking eyes out with several sets of fingers in your mouths.


I don't fucking want to sit there for a fucking hour having my mouth pulled on while I'm wide awake, I really just fucking don't. Fuck you mouth. Fuck you English dad for making sure I have a mouth that needs god damn *fixing* all the time and just fuck this. I want to cry and eat pudding.
