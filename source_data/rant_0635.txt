Fuck you assholes who abuse Ritalin or other prescription medications

Some of us actually need it to function in everyday life, to even hold a damn conversation without drifting off in the middle of a sentence. It's because of you that in the last 10 years, regulations have tightened up so much.  I've gone from being able to get 6 months supply with one script, to 3 months, to one month at a time. Now, I've checked 5 damn pharmacies, and I can't find a single one with my medicine in stock, and it's only going to get worse in the next few months. (It's the end of the year, and drug companies are tightening up their supply b/c they are only able to make a certain amount every ear)

Oh, and fuck you regulators. Can't you make it a bit easier on a guy who has take this medication for almost 20 years, and not abused (or given it to others to abuse) it a single time? I can understand not trusting high school kids (heck, I remember the $15/pill I was offered was VERY TEMPTING) but I'm a grown-ass man, with a decent job.

Finally, fuck you assholes who will inevitably come in and say that I shouldn't be reliant on medication. Tell people with glasses that they shouldn't be reliant on them, or people without legs, they shouldn't be in a wheelchair. I've got a documented medical condition, and I've found a way to cope, and anything beyond that is none of your business.
