A friend texted me saying she tried to overdose. I don't know what to do.

Thing is, we're barely friends. We're just acquaintances, we talk sometimes, whatever. She asked for my phone number for I guess this reason. 

I'm have a very small circle of friends, and I rarely go out. It's this kind of shit that makes me not want to talk to people. I've never been in a situation like this before. 

Here's the text (we're in highschool, btw):

&gt; Hey (my name)? 

&gt;Guess you are not gonna wake up. Well I gotta say something and you're the lucky winner!

&gt;I tried to overdose but it didn't work. Now I have to go to school and ......I don't want to though. I don't think I can... I'm sorry for telling you this.

I'm freaking out and shaking. I didn't ask for this. What do I do?

EDIT: [More texts.](http://imgur.com/LWs6xHL) I think I messed up.
