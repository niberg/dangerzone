I'm not socially awkward but, FUCK

I CAN TALK TOO ANYONE, but fuck if i can make that friendly connection. It seems like no matter how much i talk about our common interest, i just get forgotten. Maybe it's my face (Though i've dated plenty of chicks above an 8), but I just don't feel like i make an impact and it pisses me off. I just want to have the best friends that i can call my best men one day but, it's not happening. I want to be remembered, I want to be that guy that everyone wants to hang out with...but, i feel like i never will be. Maybe I'm not original/crazy enough, idk.
