I'm thinking about it

I have C-1 headaches.  Take your knuckle and press it into that soft area down and back from your ear where the skull meets the spine.  Feel that pain light up in your neck and temples?  That's me.

Most days are a [2]-[4] with spikes into [6].  Sometimes, they're [8].  I miss a lot of work.  I don't go out for social activities much.  I stay home.

I'm being referred to pain management.  I don't mind that, I'm in pain, I need help managing it.  The hydrocodone I've been on is now a Schedule II which is a nuisance, but I can deal with that.

My new doctor's in-processing packet has a 4-page *Informed Consent* that wants me to swear off all controlled substances.  Considering the hydrocodone doesn't last and I've been using cannabis for the last year and a half or two, this is a problem.

Essentially, I'm faced with the possibility that no doctor in this state will help me.  I'll know after my appointment tomorrow, but it looks to me like it's time to get my affairs in order.
