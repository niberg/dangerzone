Fuck it, I'm done.

I'm gonna go over why I'm going to kill myself, and whether I do it this week or in a few years is to be determined, but it *is* going to happen.

First, I'm ugly. No questioning it, it's not an opinionated thing, it's true. Next, I'm transwoman. But I'm not the attractive transwoman that you see in interviews talking about equality, because I look nothing like a woman. I look as fucking manly as you could imagine. So as far as looks go, I'm a disgusting shitbag that nobody would ever want to interact with. In fact, many people go out of their way to assault and murder trans people, so if I don't kill myself, I'd have that to look forward to.

I was quite literally dropped on my head as a kid, several times. I also inhaled condensed air when I was young, which from what I've read, can really fuck you up in the head if you survive it. So, I'm also an idiot. Like, I can't solve things easily, etc. When I get angry or mad I can't control myself and I'll punch my self in the head, which leads me to believe that I'm just mildly retarded. 

So what I've decided is that I'll just stop doing school work (Which I'm already far behind on, and since I'm doing virtual school I don't have to go into class), play games all day, eat shitty food, and just be a loser until I kill myself. Which sounds pretty good, and I shouldn't try to maintain or improve myself because I'm just gonna end up killing myself at some point anyways.

So I'm really just posting here to see what you think of that plan, because so far I don't see any downsides to it.
