The beanie hat fad kills me.

O boy. I just had to say this. I went back to my local community college to take a class and guess what I saw, all these stupid ass kids in tight as shit pants wearing these beanies when its not cold outside yet as well as indoors. They don't even cover the ears and just droop over the back like some rag. I don't get it. What is the statement? All these kids are annoying as fuck and seem to know everything already. And don't even get me started on their music. One kid told me today I need to listen to some "now stuff." He mentioned this tween money flash in pan band called "We are the in crowd." I almost laughed when I looked it up. It all sounds the same. I hear the screaming wallet of daddy's money pandering to these kids trying so hard to identify themselves as hardcore I guess, maybe, I don't know. I kindly told this kid in the stupid fucking neff beanie I respectfully found zero interest in this music. He looked at me like I was way out of the loop. I'll admit I have a problem instantly judging fuckers with the beanies. Just wanted to let everyone know. whew.
