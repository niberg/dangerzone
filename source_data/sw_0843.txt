laying in a hospital bed

i've been told that i'm okay to access the internet at hospital, so, im just going to post here, as its the only place i can come to now.

this is a follow on from my previous post
http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2kxp1h/i_guess_this_is_it/

apparently i was lucky, the medication was almost fully absorbed into my body, but they managed to do some stuff before the worst had happened. i've got permannt liver damage and will be in pain for a while.

thank you to everybody for the support in my previous thread. **love you all &lt;3**

ps sorry for grammar andspellings and everything else, best i can do with my current situation
