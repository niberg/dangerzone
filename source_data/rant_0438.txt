Sick and tired of these threads

In /r/shadowofmordor I am sick and tired of threads like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/shadowofmordor/comments/2kj0wt/how_in_the_hell_do_i_kill_this_guy/) asking, "How do I kill X Captain/Warchief when he's immune to everything except for Y?"

If you took 5 seconds to do a damn SEARCH you would have your answer!  But no, you're too damn lazy, or just want the karma, and you make a new post.  I can't tell you how many times the answer to those posts was, "Stun him" or, "Use his weakness".  It's starting to irritate me seeing these threads.
