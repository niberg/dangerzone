Don't click. I'm just here ranting about my boyfriend thank you.

Okay.
So this guy, whom I just met for a few weeks told me that he's in love with me. love at first sight and stuff. He told my best friend, my friends,  everyone basically before admitting it to me himself. I accepted because who wouldn't want a hot piece of Italian ass for themselves, RIGHT?

So. I'm 21. Never had any dating experience (not because I'm ugly, or I have halitosis or whatever. I just said no to everyone). Virgin. Never been kissed.

And this guy came in and took away my first EVERYTHING except for my virginity (we fooled around, but never penetrated me mostly due to the fact that his d*ck is the size of a baguette and that freaked me out).He was adamant on keeping my virginity intact, even mentioning that he only wants to take me after we marry (also seems far-fetched, he is the kind of guy who is into casual sex and stuff).

Alright. Enough with the juvenile introduction.
I sent him to the airport recently because he needs to fly over to another country for work. He's coming back this christmas.
It's been 3 days since. I miss him so badly. His touch. The rough scratches of his stubble on my naked skin. His minty breath. His rare declarations of love. His smell. His presence. He is basically every girl's dream come true (I mean, who on earth twirls and dips their gf in the middle of a mall??????? He's like a walking,breathing, talking romance novel hero) and I, in my inexperience and rigidity is entranced by it all.

Also, I can't believe the fact that the first Armani I ever wore is his boxer shorts.

Haha.
I miss you so much I wish I could just forget you, _____.
You're too good for me, for this insecure little girl that I am afraid that one day I'll wake up cold, alone with the dawn of realization that you never loved me like you said you do. That I was just a little game.
