Brain dump Gibberish.

God, why can't I look like her?     Why does she keep telling me I'm broken?     Why am I not good enough for her?    Is she waking up to come tell me I'm retarded again?     I know I'm slow, but why does my own mom have to tell me that?    Am I dying?whydidmyheartjustdothatohgodnotanothenosebleedmigraine.

I hope it snows tonight.     Then I don't have to be ugly tomorrow.     Maybe I should be a hypocrite to Jude and Cody and cut myself.    Then the pretty red bird in my bone cage can come out... That sounded emo, haha.     Maybe I should text Cody and cry, I kinda want to see the snow tomorrow, but I'm tired and want to sleep forever.     I read online that swallowing a bunch of pills is painful, do I need to suffer before I go?     That was a weird swallow breath.     Maybe I could hang myself.     I should write a note first.     Maybe I should use the last three rough drafts.

Is this how it feels to be dying... Empty?
