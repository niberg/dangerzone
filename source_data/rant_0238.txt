Dammit, CNN!

You've just walked us up to a closed elevator in Manchester, NH because *that's* the elevator the election officials will take when they go to formalize their state's results. What a significant fucking detail for the voters to make note of! And you've only just turned off that ridiculous Darth Vader drum track while your panel was speaking. It's been on a constant loop, even during live reporting for quite some time and it didn't matter at all that you modulated the volume a bit. It shouldn't be playing *at all* while you're delivering actual reporting and coverage. 

We know it's an election day in the U.S., we know several key races are tight and we know that control of the Senate is on the line. But why do you always have to be so obnoxious when you are covering election returns? 

Pathetic.
