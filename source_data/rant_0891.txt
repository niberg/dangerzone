My girlfriend has a real shithead of a friend.

I'm getting really sick of this new friend of hers.

She was a new hire at the restaurant she works at, about a year ago. They weren't friends at first, but they eventually became friends.

My girlfriend works 2 jobs, both full time. She makes a lot of money doing it. I also work, and make a good amount of money. This new friend of hers only has the one job, and she works part time. She makes almost no tips because she isn't a very good server and people don't really like her. As a matter of fact, more people leave complaints about her than leave her decent tips.

But in the last few months, she's latched onto my girlfriend like crazy. At first, she would just ask for a couple of cigarettes every night. Then, she was asking for 15$ to buy a pack of cigarettes. My girlfriend has a problem saying no. 

Skip ahead a month, now she calls my girlfriend crying that she can't afford gas. My girlfriend starts to help her pay for gas. Then, a few weeks later, she crashes her car (which was her grandmas car). Now, every couple of days, she asks if she can borrow my girlfriend's car. Today, she asked to borrow her car when they finish work, which means I have to drive to her work at 2AM tonight (because this girl won't offer to drive her home) to pick my girlfriend up. She has no regard for how it affects my girlfriend, or me.

She asks my girlfriend if she wants to hang out, and then ends up taking my GF out and conveniently gets a free lunch and/or dinner out of it. She knows my girlfriend will pick up the tab.

Our money has bought this girl about a half a dozen tanks of gas, at least a dozen meals, a gym pass, endless cigarettes and she even bummed money off of us to buy cocaine. 

I'm so sick of this "friend".
