I just need to rant on about life, I feel lonely.

I'm 21 and so much crap has happened and I really dislike the way my life is and I can't change most of it. 

I do have a great family, and some really good friends, but I just feel lonely. I have never had an SO; I want to be able to have someone I can hug and cuddle, someone that I can enjoy my time with, share my life with. But most importantly, someone who will care about me and not care about my disability.

I have arthritis throughout my entire body, making a lot of things difficult to do. I can walk, but what takes someone two minutes to cross takes me fifteen. And by the end of that, I'm tired and my body is sore. For this reason, I own a wheelchair for days I'm out all day, but someone has to push me for I can't push myself. 

I know because of my disability, I do not go out much, at all, unless someone takes me with them, which is rare. I can't drive, nor can I afford to take a taxi everywhere. 


Then my personality comes into place, which just doesn't help with me wanting to meet people. I have always been really shy. I can never gather courage to just walk up to someone and start a conversation. Granted I'm starting to get better at that, but I still need a lot of work there. If someone comes to talk to me, I'll talk, because I didn't have to start it, but it still is a little awkward for me. I'm just the silent person observing, not really doing much of anything.


I'm just fed up with the cards I've been given in life. I am not happy, but people think I am. I hate not being able to go out as much with people, or staying up late with friends, because I just physically can't. I want to be able to do so many things, but I have to plan everything way in advance and even still, I won't be able to because my body disagrees or I'm too scared to anyway.

Tldr: just really fed up with everything and wish I had someone to call my own.
