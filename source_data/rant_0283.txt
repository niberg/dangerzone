Yes, I am out to get you

I can't stand how big of a mouth you've got. I'm tired of the shik-talking you do about me to everyone all the time, and yet, you're always coming to me for help. Stop acting like you're the expert if this is the case. 

I let you off with a verbal reminder of the tardy policy after I heard someone else say "she's always late. That's nothing new," to the person you were supposed to relieve. That means there are multiple people who have noticed your tardiness. You're lucky you still have a job and that I didn't write you up..

And I still haven't! I let you slide when your husband didn't activate your alarm... I let you slide another week after that... Now you want to say something when I give you written documentation to sign indicating that you were late because I didn't ask for your whole life story as to why? You wrote "traffic" on the slip, sister. I'm in charge of three departments and two locations. I don't have time to sit down with you and listen to your sap story about how you got caught up in traffic. If this was a life or death situation, you would have called or not shown up. However, you did neither of those things. You showed up, fifteen minutes late, at least once every week complaining about traffic and toting your big bag of breakfast that you get for yourself. How many people get away with that on a regular basis? I had to step away from my own job to pick up your slack week after week because you can't come in on time. Traffic is a part of life. You're an adult. Plan for that. Don't come to work with your McDonald's breakfast and blame it on traffic. What you can do, though, is continue to talk smack about me to your colleagues about how hard I am as a supervisor. You made yourself the example and now I don't have to do much else for the rest to get their acts together.
