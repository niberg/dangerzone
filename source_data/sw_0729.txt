I wish i had courage, i wish i had a dad, i wish it was over.

Im a 15m that lives in a fairly nice part of California and that lives in a wealthy family. But the last year, every single day, i have thought about suicide. It first started with these little thoughts that were quickly dismissed, but since August they have been getting worse to the point were i have planned it (putting a sign on my door saying "dont come in. Just call the police" and ODing on sleeping pills). What makes me want to end it all is the fact that i have little to no courage, like i can barely ask someone for help on a math problem without it felling like im about to perform a concert in front of a thousand people. And lastly, i  have  to deal with a deadbeat piece of shit dad who refuses to pay child support, has also physically and mentally abused me since i was born, and who constantly breaks into my mom and myselfs house to steal stuff.
*He doesnt live with us anymore
I wish i had courage, i wish i had a dad, i wish it was over.
