I like movies

Its always sad to see a movie made by great people about great people. All the struggle they go trough, all the pain they suffer. But at the end they always succeed. At least in some way. Movies, video games and music are the only thing that excite me anymore. I don't care for anything else. I don't want to know anything else. I don't want to do anything else but enjoy them. I can never achieve the greatness that is depicted in media. I am not smart, I am not charismatic, I don't have anything special. I don't want to be the one who's purpose is to just reproduce. 

Sorry but I don't have that much to say. I just know that if I end up with somekind of mind eating deskjob I will just kill myself.

At least I know which song I will listen to after taking my pills or while I hang myself.

It will be the great.
