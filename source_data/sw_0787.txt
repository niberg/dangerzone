I'm disappointed in how I've been performing in school this term.

I'm usually a pretty good student: my GPA is 3.75 and I usually make A-s, with a few As and fewer grades in the B range.  But this term I've been doing considerably worse.  I had to drop my abstract-algebra class because I was so lost and now I'm only taking three classes.  But even though I'm now officially a part-time student I'm not doing that great.  If the semester were to end today, I'd have like a D+ in differential equations.  I have a test in that class on Wednesday and I'm trying to study so I can improve my grade but there's so much material to review.  I'm not used to having so much pressure on me to perform well on a particular assignment because usually my grades are so good that any one bad grade is no big deal.  I don't know if I could live with myself if I got less than a B- (my all time low) in this DE class.
