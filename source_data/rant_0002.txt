On my last leg

I made this account just so I could post this rant... 

I can't deal with her any more. I have worked with my coworker for a bit over a year now and finally I have lost the will to work/live. A lot of people would be like well just quit... I would but I feel like it's not that simple and I feel obliged my boss (who is the greatest boss ever!). He gave me a second chance, pays me well and treats me well. 

Some of her habits that irk me to no end include:

-Talking over the top of me/others when I was obviously speaking first

-She makes everything about her

-She is lazy

-She skinny shames me and if I ever said anything about her weight well I'd probably be fired... 

-I can't talk about me or my hobbies but if I were to not ask her follow up questions about what she did on the weekend all hell would break lose. 

-Everything I do is wrong, I feel like I have lost all confidence to do my job. 


I want to talk to my boss but I know he will say that's just the way she is and nothing will get done. The girl before me quit because of her and I can see why. My boss really likes her for some unknown reason, I don't know how people can stand being around her for more than a second... 

I dunno, I just wanted to rant. Feels good to finally tell someone why I don't like her, everyone else seems to like her...
