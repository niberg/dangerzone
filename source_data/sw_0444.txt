I'm self destructing. I'm getting very sad over even the tinniest of things.

I've been thinking of killing myself for over a decade. It's never been like this before. I'm not as low as I've ever been, but it's constant. I think about it constantly.
 
I was walking on the side walk. The car were going by at 50ish. I felt my legs tense up ready to jump every time I saw a big truck coming. I have strong urge to kill myself over little things. I'm not sane.
