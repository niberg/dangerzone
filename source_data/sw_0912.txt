It's been planned fore months but I want to live

It's difficult to express in words how I'm feeling. I don't think I would be in this situation if I was able to do so. 

For several months, I've been giving myself time for treatment to help me and ease my depression. I've been trying truly but it's still a struggle. As I edge closer to my date which I planned months ago, I grow continually more emotionally more volatile. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a sick quest for death. I don't want to die but living with this depression and chronic incapacitating obsessive thoughts regarding death...well it's just beyond difficult. 

I've tried a multitude of treatments and therapies. My issues started in my teens, since then I've been through years of med trials and combos, OP, IP, IOP. I've tried really hard to beat this demon-like mental illness. 

I'm growing more impulsive. The smallest things set me off. I act stupidly, without care for my life, or health. I have become physically numb, so much so that my self harm has been slowly growing worse. 

Logically, I know that there's no reason to go through with my plan in November but emotionally I struggle to let the date go. I've managed to get more time off from college, keep my scholarship, my mental health treatment will be covered 100% now. But still...I'm stuck on this date. 

I want to scream and cry and want a hug and to be comforted and to just to feel safe and loved. 

I'm trying to change my thought process, to get this stupid date out of my head. To give myself more time...I don't know what to do anymore.
