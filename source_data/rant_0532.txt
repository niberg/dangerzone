What the fuck is wrong with reddit users?

How is it that I can go to a lighthearted sub and post the most innocuous comment that doesn't affect anyone, personally, anywhere, at any time, and I will still get some idiot trying to fight me over it. What the fuck. Some of us kill time looking at subs about our favorite TV shows or pictures of cute animals because our lives are shitty and stressful enough as it is and we'd just like 5 minutes of something lighthearted. I've had four major surgical procedures in the last two years and have been in chronic pain, I have shitty family, and all I want to do is look at a fucking picture of a cute dog or a still from my favorite cartoon and NOT want to fucking kill myself for a few seconds. What the fuck is wrong with people halfway around the world that they have to start shit with total strangers to feel witty and smart and useful? Fuck this place. Fuck the internet. I wouldn't let random asshole strangers through the front door of my house, so why the fuck do I let them into my home via cesspool websites like this?
