Been wanting to disappear for about three years now

I have been wanting to disappear for about three years now.  Not die and go to a supposed Heaven, I just want to disappear because life and humans can be really shitty, even me.  I hate myself.

My grandparents want me in college and with a job, so I have both of those things right now.  I don't want to be an adult though.  I just can't bring myself to give a shit about my future when I want to die so badly. I have a few people in my life that are precious to me, but that doesn't make a difference in my feelings of wanting to disappear. I have never been happy or comfortable with myself.  I've never been able to consistently care about myself or be involved with anything that's good for me like a hobby, or exercise, or hanging out with friends.

Someday, I hope I get the courage to kill myself.  At least for me personally, probably the only reason I haven't is because I'm not into drugs or drinking. I'd probably get brave enough if I got wasted or something, but for some reason I want to die sober.  I feel like if i didn't, it'd make my family and everyone think that I died because my mind and capacity for rational thought was destroyed by drugs or alcohol.  I'm already so incapacitated by depression and anxiety that I can hardly live my life sober, which is why I feel like adding anything else will temporarily relieve me, but ultimately exacerbate the problems I am having.

I'm so tired all the time, I can hardly handle 4 hour shifts at work.  I can't manage my life healthily or properly, I just can't bring myself to care anymore.  I'm only working and in school because I feel like it would be worse to lay around doing nothing.
