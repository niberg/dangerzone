Why does it matter?

I don't know if I am suicidal, but there is this thought in my head that I want to die. The thought comes and goes. Sometimes it lingers for days. Like now. I've been thinking about how much I just want to die. I know that suicide is a selfish act, which is why even when the thought crossed my mind, I never saw it as a viable option. I don't want to hurt the people around me, mainly my family. 

But the thought has been changing. Now I'm thinking, why does it matter? Yes, they are my family, but most of the time I just feel totally and completely alone. I don't talk to my mom or my brother very often. The same can be said for my other relatives. What right does anyone have to make me feel guilty about taking my own life? If I am unhappy, why can't it just be over?

I feel stuck, and I run the options and everything is so fucking hard. I have no support, whatsoever. Even if I asked for it. My mom would just feel guilty that she can't do anything for me. My dad is in the Philippines. I haven't talked to him in a year. I try to do it on my own, but I struggle everyday. I try to take the steps. I do the therapy. I take the antidepressants. I try, but its so hard doing it alone. I am stuck and I am unhappy, so if I killed myself, why does it matter? Why am I supposed to struggle day after day, year after year, so that eventually one day, someday, far in the future, it might get better? But to get there, I have to work so fucking hard and be in so much pain.

If someone can just give me a good reason to keep going, because I just can't see it anymore... Thanks for reading...
