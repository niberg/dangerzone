Microsoft can go fuck itself.

I have a Dell laptop that runs windows XP, it serves me well because it can run Fallout 3. I have to install an upgrade to the .NET framework so A Tale of Two Wastelands can fucking run. But no, Microsoft had to end support for XP because better shite exists.  And Bethesda can't fucking patch it because FO3 uses a different engine to FNV. 

TL;DR: My favourite Bethesda game can't run because Microsoft are a bunch of cock-sucking shiteheads.
