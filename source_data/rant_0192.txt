Microsoft Word just crashed..

...and took 60% of my lab report with it!! I am so angry right now and feel like the only logical thing to do next is dashing the computer screen or throwing the computer off the balcony. 
I have been working on it since Saturday last week and - here's the funny part - it's supposed to be turned in tomorrow. Fuck me right?

It all happened so quickly. I was writing on the last paragraph when, suddenly, everything froze. A few seconds later word shut down and at first I thought like - hey, no biggie, I recently saved it. Looked for it in saved documents aand.. it. wasn't. there.  

Panic mode - activated

I quickly type on google "How the fuck do I retrieve an unsaved document from Microsoft Word?!" and learn that the program actually auto saves your document a few times every hour. I follow the walk through on how to find the lost file, and for a minute it looks like everything will be worked out. Oh, how wrong I was. Because as it turns out, ONE OF MY FUCKING HARD DRIVES (I think that's what it's called..?) HAS ZERO, YES, 0, GIGABYTES LEFT AND WORD HAD APPARENTLY NOT SAVED A SINGLE TIME. Not once, since Tuesday. more than half of my work is just..gone. 

And now i'm here, sitting in my chair like a depressed potato and wondering what kind of bad shit I've done lately that made karma do this to me. 

I don't care if no one sees this, I just needed to get this out of my system. Also, I have no idea if this goes in this subreddit. Sorry if it doesn't.
