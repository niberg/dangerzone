Want a way out.

I want to kill myself and to be honest a large portion of why I'm still here is because I don't have a way out. Overdosing takes to long and while there's train tracks just over a mile from where I live I'm worried about someone stopping me and I don't know what to do. Talking to people just doesn't help. Psychologists just stress me out and make it worse.
