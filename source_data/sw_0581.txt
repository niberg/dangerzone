Just exhausting....

I'm not suicidal right now. But today's events make me.....disenchanted with the world. I'm tired of trying to be the change I wish to see in the world, and having people shit all over me. 

Long story short, I've been trying (politely and diplomatically) for weeks to get my former employer to mail me my last 2 paychecks. Yesterday I told them I intend to file a formal complaint with the DOL if I haven't received them within a week. What do I get for my politeness, diplomacy, and hard work?

"I'll mail it when I'm damn good and ready. You have a nasty attitude."

"Do not use me as a reference; I will tell them about your horrible attitude. You are not eligible for rehire."

People really fucking suck.
