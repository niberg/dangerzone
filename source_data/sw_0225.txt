Suicide seems logical at this point.

I don't know how to feel anymore, as cliche as that sounds. I seem to cause more grief and pain than any other emotion to the people I love. I know they love me too, but there is a strain I put on them and I can tell they're growing further and further from me. I just want my family to be happy and I just think without me they truly would have the chance. I've made huge fuck ups in life, and I think I've had my peak already early on, I'm only 22, but I can't deal waking up every day just waiting for the day to be over. I can't enjoy life living like this.. And I don't know if anyone will read this but I feel somewhat better after putting this out there.
