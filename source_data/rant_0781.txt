mother f*cking fleas

9 years I've had my cat and he's never had fleas, until now.

Holy fuck, they are the most infuriating fucking creatures. The cat has been treated and is happy as fucking larry and I'm covered in bites. Turns out I'm allergic to the bites, so they're super fucking itchy, and sore. My legs are going to be scarred. The whole house has been vacuummed within an inch of its life, steam cleaned, covered in flea removal products, anything small enough to go in the washing machine as been washed at the highest temperature possible, and the little fuckers are still here! WHAT THE FUCK DOES IT TAKE TO KILL THESE BASTARDS?!

Pest control are coming tomorrow, thank fuck. I actually cried on Friday because my legs were so itchy and I couldn't sleep. My skin is crawling...
