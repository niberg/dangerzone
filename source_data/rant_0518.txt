"Please listen carefully as our menu options have changed."

No they haven't. Stop lying to me. You know they haven't, and I know they haven't. Hell, you don't even put a time limit on this message. I can call back in a year and you're still going to tell me that your menu options have changed. What are you telling me? That you had some alpha menu that you used for a week when you had ten customers total? 

Why would you change the menu? If 1 is tech support and 2 is billing and 3 is sales and now you have to add, I don't know, legal department, you're going to make them 4, right? You're not going to do something stupid and shove them in between billing and sales. So now let's look at the situation. Anyone calling for legal has never heard your menu before. Anyone calling for anyone else has only the same menu as the last time they needed to call. The new information is irrelevant. Either the caller knows they need to listen carefully, or they don't and can just press the button they know is right.

No, stop bullshitting. This isn't about accurate phone routing; this is about you wanting to artificially shorten your queue times. I don't get dropped into the queue to wait for someone until I fully negotiate your little IVR maze, do I? Or even if I do, it's supposed to *feel* shorter, since I got to push some buttons first, right. Screw you. If you want to shorten your queue times, *hire some more CSRs*.
