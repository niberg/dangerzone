How fucking shitty my internet download speeds are, I get 0.5 Mbps at most

We pay the same as people getting 50Mbps and we've always had the shittest internet in the area. We complained and they recommended using the internet between the hours of 01:00AM and 05:00AM. Turns out we're the last in the area to be getting fibre optics as well so it'll be shit for a good while longer.
