"The guy is always wrong" bull

It's really started annoying me lately, this whole thing where "if she's mad, apologies even if you haven't done anything wrong" thing. I get it, it's probably just an internet thing, but serious, it seems to be everywhere.

If she can't admit she's wrong on occasion and won't listen to reasonable arguments, or simply admit what's troubling her, she's crazy. And forcing you to keep apologizing when it's got nothing to do with you is wrong. She's not worth it. Quite frankly it's madness and it's been ticking me of.

It's stupid and it's unfair, anyone who don't have some common sense to accept that they can be wrong aren't worth it. (oh and the same thing goes the other way around, but this mostly refers to the internet joke/trend thingey)

(FIY, I'm a girl - before people start asking)
