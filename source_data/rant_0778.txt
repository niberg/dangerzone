My insane Land Lady

So my mum lives in a rented house, and after 22 years the owners give her new carpets. Nice! The land lady, an ancient, wealthy Irish woman, who often harasses my mom tells her over the phone on two separate occasions that she can leave anything in the house that she thinks would compromise her safety to try and move. Twice. 

So the day the carpet guys are there, I'm in town and just hang out to monitor things. Land Lady shows up and throws a fucking fit, because the carpet guys tell her it's $90 extra for them to move shit around. She claims that she told my mom to remove everything, and then claims that we're out to rob the home owner of $90(?) I try my best to stay calm because this spooky 85 year old is talking a ton of shit on my mom. I tell her that it would make zero sense for us to intentionally leave stuff in the house to stick the home owner with a slightly larger bill. How would we benefit from sticking it to the home owner (who is way way nicer than this lady)?

She get's super angry and gets in her car. Before she drives off she shoots me a glace and snarls- "It's a small town Wildtalon. Very Small."

Like wtf? Was that a threat? I'm so clueless to what that meant but I'm just incensed that she would lie, or forget and then blame my mom about this shit. My mom has a back problem, and had the Land Lady said "move everything out" my mom would have called me to move it. It would have taken 4 minutes.

Fucking stupid.
