I believe the word you're looking for is FEELINGS not "feels"

What the fuck is this "feels" shit and when is it going away? What's wrong with just saying feelings? I lose interest in whatever I'm reading as soon as the person says "these feels" or "oh man, those feels again"  especially if followed by "is someone cutting onions in here?" Just say you have fucking feelings like normal people do. Oh wait, you have to be quirky on Reddit. I just hope you don't use that "feels" shit in person. That word needs to die out like yesterday.
