When something is wound it must unravel. sometimes explosively.

When something is wound it must unravel. sometimes explosively.

That's me. Right now. wound too tight and something little chips my bottle of depression and misery and they finds the weakness in the bottle and breaks me open.

i am alone and miserable. there is nothing for me here in the world except misery.

I have no father. My mother was arrest for her 4th DUI on Saturday just minutes after i get home from a party i was suppose to have fun at. i was neglected as a child by my alcoholic mother and had to raise myself with no childhood. and now....at 19 almost 20.... i realize there is no happiness.... its a lie. pain and misery are the only ways we know we are alive in this world. we exist and we are forgotten like the billions before us.

i was fine. i was handling myself being neutral. then i started working and found a girl i like. but i hate myself hate myself more than anything and for as long as i can remember. I don't believe i am good at my job even though i know i am. every time it seams like its going to get better and maybe i will find something good.....everything come crashing down.

I tried to kill myself my freshman yer of high school and scene that time i felt like i wanted to die a few times. this is the first time i though I might actually do something and end it cause there is nothing but misery. ending it seams like the only way i will get peace.

"What can you do when the world wants you to bury you beneath it...you have to believe they were wrong" -You can try and believe that, but you know deep down you will be miserable.

I think i might actually do it...... this might be the final good bye
