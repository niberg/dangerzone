So drunk I feel I could stab myself without feeling pain...

I've got social anxiety so I can't make new friends.  I've got social anxiety so the friends I make I have no chance of keeping.  I hate people because I over think every conversation and every single interaction with another human being.  I want to have friends but I can't!  I'm too paranoid about what other people think!  I've had friends that have tried to drag me out to parties and what not but it never resulted in anything.  I always end up screwing it up because I expect it will end up in me being alone and screwing up the relationship due to some failure based on some aspect of my social anxiety.  Give me some reason to live!  Give me some hope!  Please!

This my anxiety talking, but if today's suicide doesn't workout...I may in the future post with this account because I wasn't enough to kill myself with this post.  I just want a legit mate reason to survive and continue living.  At this point there is absolutely no point.  I'm only alive because I figure it's better than not...I guess.  But now...I thing the "better than not" is just pointless.  Please tell me why to live.  Please!  Because...I feel hopeless!  Please!
