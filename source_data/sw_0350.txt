Help

I don't know what's going on in my head and I feel like I'm losing it. There's nothing particularly wrong with my life - I have a good job and family and friends but I just don't feel right and haven't for months. I'm so tired and just don't want to be here anymore, what's the point? No one understands as they say I have nothing to be depressed about and I don't understand either. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore, I find no enjoyment in anything and I just want out. I tried to OD a few weeks ago and just fucked that up. I've not been on here before but I really just want to speak to anyone else that has ever felt the same because I am just losing all hope I will ever feel normal again. Antidepressants haven't worked and I feel like I've given it a shot so I have no choice but to call it a day now.
