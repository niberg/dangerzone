Seriously, i just want to fucking log on on my fucking computer. WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO CHANGE MY FUCKING PASSWORD, THAT I HAVE USED FOR YEARS, RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS THE BIG FUCKING EMERGENCY APPLE? I DONT WANT TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD, I WANT TO FUCKING LOG IN ON MY COMPUTER, BUT NO. I HAVE TO CHANGE IT FOR NO FUCKING REASON.
