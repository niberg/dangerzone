To my roommate about halloween

your a fuckin retard. I told you on oct 5th that we should have an offensive halloween costume party. the other 3 roommates didnt say anything but you said no to the party because you seem to think you have to buy the booze and invite people so I didnt take the time off from work. now 2 days before halloween you go out and get items for your halloween costume for a party that you just planned and expect the other roommates to be ok with it and have the time off to go to the party.
