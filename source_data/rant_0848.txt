I'll tell you what's wrong with the world, jackass.

I have a friend. He is fresh out of high school. All he ever wants to do is debate and argue about what the biggest problem the world faces. "Bro, religious wars will kill us all" or "bro, if we don't start being green the worlds gonna die". He spends all day whining and crying about problems that he could NEVER EVER have any influence on the outcome. You make an argument, and he lists off all sorts of bullshit statistics and news articles he got off of the Colbert Report or yahoo news. What ever, if he wants to throw his life away worrying about the fact that "everybody is an idiot but me so we're all gonna die of starvation" or some shit, fine. But here's where I drew the line. He tried to tell me that my father (now into his 50s) knows nothing about the world, and how he is a biased idiot. Let me tell you about my dad. He built our house with his bare hands. Just him. Nobody helped, he built the entire thing. He's had a stable job his whole life. He's raised an awesome family. You ask him anything about the world, and he has an answer. A correct answer. While most people are "captain hindsite" and they have the answer to an issue after things went wrong, he knows the answer as soon as the issue arises. So to that "friend": tell me what the fuck you've done with your life. You know nothing about the world from sitting in your moms basement eating fucking hotdogs all day long and watching the news. My father, who has done more with his life than you and your dis functional family could ever complete in 500 years, certainly knows more than you. So don't go acting like he's just some dumb hick from the sticks. You know what's wrong with the world? You. There are too many fucking people like you.
