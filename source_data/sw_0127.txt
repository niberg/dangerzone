I just don't know where to go anymore..

**WARNING: might be a really long post.. if you can please try to read it all**


**pre-2001/pre-america :**

I was born in an Asian family, mom, dad, sister. I was a normal kid, I'd say, playing with friends on the playground, toys, etc. But also at the same time, I was bullied for my physical appearance and weight by people around me. Things were rough back then, not financially but family-wise. My parents always fought and my sister and I always found ourselves in the middle, trying to stop them. Domestic violence was a common thing to see, tears rolling down our faces each time, but powerless to do anything. We also had happy times, when we laughed and loved, but always in the back of my mind, I was always worried for the next wave of storm that would strike our family.


**2001 - 2011 :**

yay we've finally arrived in the U.S! Things were okay, a brand new start with a brand new job for my dad. Shortly though, the storm struck us for many more years. Elementary years were the glory years, it was fun with friends, etc. 

Soon came **junior high**, again the bullying by people, who would actually end up becoming my bestest of friends for a short period of time. I excelled in school, sweeping awards in all subjects at the end of my 8th grade year, and gaining somewhat of appreciation and respect from others.

**High school**, oh lord that was a mess. I might've started good, but it all went crumbling down in a landslide. During my sophomore year, my dad quit his prestigious and secure job, and decided to be a stay-at-home dad, while working from home. There was tension in the air, from financial issues and just stress. In addition, I was reaching a rebellious stage of my life just, not paying attention to school, cheating, eating unhealthily (I gained a LOT of weight during my junior year). Finally though during my senior year, I was able to lose weight, become healthy, shake off the negativity, graduate within the top 10 out of almost 700 people in my class, and get accepted into a prestigious university. But certain problems and issues persisted..

**College - present**

When I first entered college, I felt miserable; I was lonely, due to the fact that I wasn't being able to interact with enough people. I lived off-campus, and being a freshman, AND adding the fact that I'm extremely shy just killed me. I was scared to join clubs, I didn't know anyone, and all I could do was just go to class and try to talk to as many people I knew from pre-college. Even with this, I was able to keep my life healthy, being really fit, working out every day, and running marathons. While all of this, I put on a fake smile and a fake face, to look like everything was working out alright, even though everything was in shambles. Then a downfall struck; I was caught helping people cheat (I promise, I studied for my tests, but I just let people use pirated books and gave them answers to stuff, why? I don't know.) through facebook, not knowing that it was a public group of the class. First strike: I was called to the student judicial services and was given a warning for my actions, which I didn't deny. During the later 2 years, I was able to somewhat bring my life back, I transferred to the computer science major, and everything seemed good, but I soon realized I was gaining a lot of weight, just eating and sleeping and coding, and soon seeing my body change made my motivation and morale weak. 

***During*** all this time, I was fighting depression, which I could never completely shake off, since it would come back even stronger than before. And earlier this year, I was finally able to come clean with my parents. I told them about what happened at school and how I've felt all this time. That moment seemed so happy, like a clog had been cleared, we all cried and had a bonding moment, and they assured me to let them know if anything was wrong. So I did. Back in June, I was involved in a bike accident, which left me with a nasty amount of bill to pay. Even though my parents offered to pay, I was working at the time and told them I was alright (It was a part-time job). Also during this past summer, I took a summer course, which I failed to pass, causing me to held back a semester. With all of this, bills, class, major, life, I just couldn't handle it and told my parents I really needed a break. Sadly this maybe wasn't inside the "help" they wanted to provide and told me that if I were to take a break from school, I was to be paying rent on my own in addition to paying hospital bills and utility bills which I was already paying.

**This** in turn, caused me to decide that I should be financially independent. Little did I know, all these bills I'd have to pay. I've been hopping from job to job, and getting into more binds, killing my morale every second that I breathe. I'm getting sick of myself and I really just want to end it all. I'm tired of living month to month; this is not the break I wanted to shake off my depression. I'm tired of being shit treated by jerk managers. There is nothing I look forward to; I don't even know why I get up in the morning anymore, it all seems so pointless. I just want to end it all in one go.

**TLDR; the struggle was real, paying off bills and trying to please my parents, and now I want to end it all**
