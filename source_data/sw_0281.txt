I feel scared and vulnerable

I'm diagnosed bipolar, 22 year old female, who is currently working interstate away from home and my boyfriend and support network.

I hardly know anyone in this city.  I've been here for 3 weeks.

My illness has been fairly under control for six months.  Last year I made a very definite attempt on my life and was on life support for a week.

I just found out this last weekend that I was sexually abused by two male friends one night three or so months ago.  I had foggy memories of the night and suspected something bad had happened but a friend just confirmed it.

I told my boyfriend about it and he is very supportive but he's furious and there is probably going to be a bit of a fall-out.  I just feel cheap, insignificant, dirty, taken advantage of.  I don't feel worthy of his love - it's as if I've been tainted.

Since I've found this all out I've felt so numb and horrible.  I can't focus.  I'm worried I'm going to fuck up my opportunity here at work.  I feel awful - like I'm moving through thick sand.   I spent the entire weekend in bed sleeping - that's nearly 50 hours.  

I live 2km near a notorious cliff jumping spot and I'm worried I'm going to lose my shit and go there and throw myself off.

I need advice :(
