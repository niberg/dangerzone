Girlfriend witnessed suicide attempt who is also suicidal (17M/16F)

My girlfriend of 3 months as dealt with depression and suicidal tendencies for a while, as have I. Long story short, she has always tried to push people away when she is in a bad place. Yesterday, she witnessed her friend come running out of the nurses office at school. She took a bunch of pills and was screaming she wanted to die. My girlfriend called me for help(I was already out of school) but I was not able to get to phone when she called. She ended up having to drag her back to nurses office, have her drugged, and then taken away in an ambulence. It sounds like the girl may have died but we I dont know yet. Anyways, I am always there for my girlfreind, but because I wasnt there this ONE time, she is extremely upset i think. She has ignored me the past 24 hours and then this morning, told me she loves me, but needs space. She is ignoring all of her friends and me. I have saved her life multiple times by calling her mom when she was about to do something dangerous. I have gone no contact with her all day. I am just posting this now because she is an attention seeker, and I thought she made the story up for attention, I just found out it was true. Not that I accused her of lying, but I just thought she was trying to get my attention as apposed to being seriously scarred. I am actually in an all day group therapy for depression and self harm, and I have tried to get her to join but she refuses help. Anyways, how do I handle a suicidal girlfriend who just witnessed her friend (most likely) kill herself. Do I go no contact and give her the space she asked for? Because we were talking very limitedly before she even asked for space.  I am so worried please help.
