Good bye.

I'm really not going to be persuaded not to do it. I'm just sort of posting this so someone remembers me. I have a lot of problems, I alienate all my friends, I'm fairly certain I'm bipolar. I can't hold down a legit job, and I've resorted to growing pot in the past. Currently on welfare. My suicide method is virtually infallible, so don't say I could end up in the hospital or something. I'm only posting this so SOMEBODY knows who I was.
