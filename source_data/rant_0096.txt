I cant stand all the different bank account features and bull shit. Sorry USbank rep that is going to have to deal with my email tomorrow...

So Ill put the message I sent here. It fucking ridiculous! Why do I need more then an email and a password to log in! when its this fucking complicated I end up making a detailed sticky note with ALLLL The account information. How is that for secure. 

Someone please tell me I am not alone in all this bullshit. 

&gt; Your Login processs is the most horrible experience ever. Why do I need to type in my user name then answer a security question and then have to put my password in. EVERY time! I dont get it. well today for some reason I was asked to answer a different security question. "Which street did I grow up on" This it stupid. I never know which question you're going to ask and since there are so many ways to write Marina Drive, Marina, Marina Dr, Marina Dr.... how are people supposed to remember the 5 different password to log into your site. Anyways I don't understand how this can all be necessary when my chase account gets away with a username and password and their site allows my computer to remember the password, I know your site blocks or just confuses this secure and useful feature. So the biggest problem is that I went to reset my password put in my card number and all the needed information. I also tried my Pin and It wont recognize my account. So was I locked out... out of spa

And then I ran out of space. Apparently they like to keep their complaint department flowing by limiting my complaint. 

Seriously If this isn't solved with less then another five minutes total of my time I will close that account
