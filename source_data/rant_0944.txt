Youtube ads

This is my first post here :D
Youtube ads. I know its supposed to be there so youtube can make some money or shit, but does it have to be every vid? Like every time I want to listen to some music or watch series, the ads. So fucking annoying. The Kay Hagan VA thing is the most annoying. Others I can skip in 5 seconds, not a prob, but the VA ones? God help me. I heard that shit so many times I have it memorized. Can't they memorize our IP address and not spam ads? Like once or twice is okay, but like 50 times................................................no.
