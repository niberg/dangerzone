I can think of zero reason not to slip my throat right now.

Who am I but a morbidly obese, addicted fuck who will never have anyone to hold, to care for, or to be loved by?

I've been patient for years now, and it hasn't gotten better, just worse and worse and worse. 

Nobody will ever want me. I am 350 lbs, and I am addicted to the stuff that made me this way. There's no way out for people like me. People like me shouldn't pollute the gene pool, so it's better off that I just die.

Who will care anyways, all I'll be is just another statistic. Nothing I have done has ever helped anybody or myself.

almost every decision I make is toxic, including writing this post. I know that to many, I'll just come off as this fat, whiney, suicidal fuck who is just a waste of resources.  I know it. 

I'm on the verge of homelessness due to my shit financial choices, ever dollar I spent is towards some stupid hedonistic of-the-moment bullshit that will get me no where, and I spend the vast majority of my days in bed just waiting, praying for death to take me in my sleep.

Sleep is the only time peace is upon me. No one judges you in your sleep, no even yourself. 

I'm ready for the long sleep, and I can't wait any longer for it.
