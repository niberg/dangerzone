MY FLATMATE!!!

EURGH!!! so this may sound a little insensitive at parts but i'm so mad right now that i don't care. So i live with 5 other people in a student flat at university and have a particular flatmate who is upsetting everyone and we can't do anything about it. he has outright been bulling someone else we live with, spreading lies about everyone else and threatening people. we told the hall manager, who has spoken to this guy and has had everything turned around to make us all seem like the ones who are attacking us. now as well, this is the mean bit, he has written what he calls physiological profiles on everyone, but because he claims to have a different mental health health issue every week, we're not getting anything done about that either. I just hate how we aren't being believed and everything is being pushed under the rug. my friend told me earlier she doesn't feel safe after him threatening us.... ERURGHRGRHI!!!
