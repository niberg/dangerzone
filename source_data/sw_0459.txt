sitting here thinking

just thinking. i have the means to get rid of myself. it would be easy enough. just walk to the closet, open the safe, and take my pick. i wouldnt be able to fuck up anymore. wouldnt be able to disappoint my family any more. wouldnt be able to fuck up at work anymore. it just seems like it would be so much easier if i didnt have to worry about all this shit anymore. i mean, whats the point? we all die at some point, and why not now? i dont really want to, but at this point life really hasnt given me much other choice. i can either live the rest of my life a fuck up who continues to disappoint, or i can just stop all the suffering and embarrassment and ridicule right now.
