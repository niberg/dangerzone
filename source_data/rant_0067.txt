I have fucking had it with people. People are shite.

I've had it, I've fucking had it.

I have been on this subreddit and that subreddit about self improvement or overcoming tragedy and that site and that place and I am at my fucking wit's end. I had a shit childhood with a narcissitic father, who just abandoned my mother and withdrawn all the financial support once promised. I have no reprisal apparent to me. I have had social anxiety for years, and too many problems in my own life to even begin justifying a relationship.

I think too much about what others say and I let "rough days" derail my plans and schemes. I let one teasing comment or insult shake me to my core. None of my friends would give a shit if I told them my issues, and frankly I have too much on my mind to give a shit about a single one of them.

I am angry, I am really fucking damn angry. I have never had such a enmitous anger in my life. I have been treated like shit by so many people. I am sick of it, sick of it all! Fuck these people, fuck my life. 

I need a goddamn year all to myself. NO ONE ELSE.
