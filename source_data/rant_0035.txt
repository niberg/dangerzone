Video Game Developers, You Are Asshats

I'm not trying to be the know-it-all about video game development here. I'm also not attacking the content of any game. I, for the most part, enjoy all the aspects of a game. Even the overly frustrating bits when you die 87 times trying to kill 1 fucking guy. Whatever. If a mission takes me 9 hours to complete, I'm still having fun because it really is just a game to me. What I *am* going to attack here is the platform in which these games come into life. 

I'm talking about major titles lacking a fucking Mac client. Like I said, I'm not some know-it-all when it comes to game development and programming, but from what I have witnessed and heard about, it's actually *easier* to program on a Mac than it is on Windows. So why does so many companies have Windows clients, but no Mac client? 

Yes, I'm aware that the majority of people game on a Windows PC. But that is so goddamn subjective I don't even want to get into it. If you don't like to game on a Mac, then congratulations, you have an opinion just like everyone else. That also doesn't mean I want to hear the Mac fanboys scream the same anthem. Whatever works for you, *works for you* and that's that. **End of discussion**.

Now we have titles like World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Guild Wars 2, and a good bit of Steam Games like Portal, Gary's Mod, The Stanley Parable, that all have Mac clients that work exceptionally well. Then you have games like Star Wars Online and Lord of the Rings Online that just feel lacking. They work, but there are weird errors and sometimes they crash. Well, if you're **not** talking about Star Wars Online. That fucking bitch crashes all the time. I don't understand the nature of the coding process, but it seems stupid to me if I can run World of Warcraft at 100fps with max graphics - I shouldn't be forced to set my graphics levels all the way down on Star Wars Online just to stop the client from freezing. I have no issues with any games crashing except that one, but some of these games just act stupid. It's not a graphics rendering problem either. The client just dies for no reason. And to me, it seems that the developer just gave up on life before perfecting the Mac client and spent all their time and energy on the PC client. 

And to me, that's fucking stupid.
