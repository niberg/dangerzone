Hopeless

Life has been boring. Its my fault. Im lazy and unmotivated doing anything to change it. Life keeps throwing rocks at me. I keep being upset, saddened and disappointed. 


Life is pointless.


The only thing that can help me is someone to take over my life, do everything for me. I dont even want to try anymore.
