Fuck you Verizon, this is why we left your shithole of a company.

Seriously? You fucking make calling your company as a required part of the setup? I don't want to activate the fucking thing with Verizon, you assholes overcharge and scam people. If I wanna buy a fucking phone, i should be able to activate it with the independent company that uses YOUR FUCKING TOWERS. 120 bucks down the drain. And to the reviewer who said it wasn't verizon only, you know nothing and are a fucking dumbass. Suck a dick Verizon.
