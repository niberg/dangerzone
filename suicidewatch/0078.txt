I want to kill myself and I don't even know why.

I just feel so damn tired every waking moment, and I can't stop thinking about how great it would be to just off myself and finally end all of the stress and pressure.

I mean I don't even know why I want to do it honestly - it's not like I have a drug problem or struggle with school, or any real issue that would usually cause someone to consider suicide. I'm just so sick of the stress and petty bullshit and feelings of inadequacy I have to deal with every day.

It would be so much better if I just did it. I'm about to go to college next year and it would probably be a lot better for my parents if they didn't have to sink 250k in higher education anyway.
