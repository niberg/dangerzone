Love

I stood in one world and looked up at the sky. 
The darkness reflected like a shaded pool of water.
A scrying mirror. 
I saw my dreams, my hopes.
I saw perfection.


I stood with two cups before me
Filled with possibility.
I tried to drink from them both and in doing so
I poisoned both.
This foul draught, is my reward.
It is my tonic at night, as the evening sun 
Reflects through my tears like glimmering shards.

The sun is fading
The warm summer dream is gone.
And the howling wind comes to prey in the night. 
It comes to pray in the night. 
My hands are numb from the cold, my heart is ice. 
May the wind sing me to sleep, 
As I fade with the setting sun.
