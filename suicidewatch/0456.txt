No one cares about me

My entire life I've been the 3rd wheel, always left out, never invited anywhere. People talk about parties or get-togethers they've had or are planning right in front of me, but never ask me to join. I've been trying to plan a trip to the city for the past 2 months but no one wants to accompany me, even my family makes up excuses not to go. I'm just tired of living around lies and tired of me. I'm not good at anything, I'm not very good looking, I'm nothing. 

I've been trying to reach out to the very few people in my life I trust, but no one cares enough to try to have a 1 on 1 situation where I can explain to them what's going on. Even if that did happen and I was able to explain my depression and suicidal thoughts I would get the same bullshit response. It gets better, it's a phase, why not just go do what makes you happy? It's no help, it'll never get better. It's not just a phase, I've wanted to die since I was 6 years old. I can't go do activities that makes me happy because being no one wants to share in my happiness, and doing things that make me happy alone makes it all worse.

I don't know what to do anymore, I die everyday that I love somebody so much but I know they will never love me back and it's nothing they or I can control. I'll be alone forever. I just want to know the warm feeling people say they get when someone says that they love you just as much as you love them, I want to wake up and not be mad that I'm alive, but I just can't, and never will. 

The most basic right someone has in their life is too choose to end it. Life isn't a gift, it's something that's forced upon you. Everyone also says that you're in control of your own life, grab it by the balls and own it. I might finally take control of my own life, by ending it.
