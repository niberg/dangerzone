100 days until it's over

It's such a relief to even type that out. 100 days. That's all I have to suffer. 100 days is all that's left as a miserable waste of human life. I've got everything for my last day planned out, and I can't wait. This is no cry for help or me seeking attention or anything. I just really wanted to write this because it gives me peace of mind to do so.
