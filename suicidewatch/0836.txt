Affairs In Order

I always get the compulsion to make sure a space is clean right before I get the urge to kill myself. What is left for me? No one cares that I exist and I'm too paranoid to go out and meet new people. I try to tell people about how I feel and they brush me off. I've gotten to the point where I don't even care anymore. I just want all the pain to go away. I sleep but, I'm tired of roaming endlessly through life without reason. I've got nothing, and that's how it's going to stay. So please give me one good reason not to end it. People hate me because I'm too fat, too poor, too depressed, too, too neurotic. I'm so tired of this life being contingent on me being in the heel of everyones boot. My biggest fuck you, would be a suicide note pointing these things out and hope that people change, but that in itself is delusional, society doesn't change because 1 loser killed themselves. So it doesn't matter I'll just write a short essay and be done with it.
