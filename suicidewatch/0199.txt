hell is getting another coward tonight

im 17 yo guy, my mom was just takin away from me cause shes a fuckin crackhead and im now living behind the library i posted this from. i dont how or why but they just left me there alone. i used to read stories to my old landlords daughter, the same landlord that handed me a trashbag and told me get what i need and leave. child services wont take me, but i have my tool so i guess hell will give me a new home. i cant breathe, talk or even think where my place is in this world and im not ready to suffer and find myself going nowhere. its 3:40pm now and ill give myself 1 more day before i become more trash like the can next to me. goodbye mom i hope you get better sorry but theres no chance for me. bye
