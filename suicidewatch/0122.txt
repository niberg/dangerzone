Last night...

Last night I took a bottle of 50 200mg ibuprofen pills and woke up today still alive.

A lot of people would feel happy and find some new reason for living after a "failed suicide attempt" (although I didn't really expect to die from 50 pills.. that's not really that many is it.. im such a coward) but I am just tired... so tired that nothing works anymore, and tired of living. Living is just a chore now... and I don't really know why I'm posting here. Just wish I was dead already.
