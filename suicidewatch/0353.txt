Just need some advice.

So my girlfriend struggles with depression, ADHD and has had bouts of self mutilation (cutting). She went to a party last night with some of her friends and this girl she went with, she had only known her a month, got her drunk and have her either a couple Molly's or extacy. Not sure which, but probably X. Anyway, this girl (let's call her B) basically ditched her and left with some other guy. At this point, girlfriend is tripping balls. She doesn't remember much of what happened, but she called me and we were talking and I was trying to figure out where she was. She didn't know where she was, who I was, or who she was. She was crying in the bathroom. Then I start hearing guys voices and she starts screaming and I hear a lot of thrashing around. She was raped by three men, and left in the bathroom. Security found her and called me. I live in North Dakota and she lives in California, so there wasn't much I could do. I called my best friend and told him to pick her up and take her to the hospital to get a rape kit done. Rape kit came back negative for sperm. We filed a report with the police as well. Now she blames herself for this and I'm afraid she's going to kill herself or severely injure herself. Her parents believe that everything can be solved through prayer and the lords help. They won't pay for psychiatric help, or even to get an evaluation. I just don't know what to do. And if she does anything, I will feel responsible. That's just how I am. 

I'm rambling at this point. Reddit, can you give me some words of advice?

Also, is this the right subreddit? Or should I x-post this to r/depression?
