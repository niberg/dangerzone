I've got a great life

Seriously. I'm honestly not trying to rub it in anyone's faces or anything, but I do. My mum and dad are fucking great. Supportive, communicative, generous, fucking lovely people. Same for my brothers. Got 10 really close friends in my hometown. Go to a 2nd rate uni (I'm not hugely smart), but it's great for the course I'm doing (A cisco course). Got a few real good friends on my course. Flatmates at Uni (I' in the UK) are fucking great, lovely people. The best I could ask for.  HAD a very very close female friend who I was seeing romantically. She stopped talking to me a couple weeks back.

this is the worst I've ever felt in my life. My life is good. A lot of people on this sub would kill for the chance at a life like mine with so mush support. But I still want to hang myself every morning and every night. So if it isn't any environmental factors....it must be me, right? 

I'm the problem? 
I'm the shit.
