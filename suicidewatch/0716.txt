my 15th birthday is in two weeks and im not sure i will make it

whats the point anymore... im going nowhere with this. my therapist does nothing and im about to go to my sixth different one. my mom doesnt understand. she thinks that it'll all be better if i have a strong connection with jesus. i havent had the heart to tell her im atheist... my fathers even worse. after the divorce, it seems like hes stopped caring about me and just cares about his new girlfriend. i dont really have friends at school... i mean im popular and everyone speaks highly of me, but i just dont fit in. its lonely. and i just dont see that point in it all anymore. im trying my fucking hardest but idk how long i can last. im not even getting anywhere with this sub... im just getting the same clich√©d responses that ive heard thousands of times...
