Still not any better...

Hi there.

I feel so alone.. I overthink everything and get really attached to people I become friends with.. My girlfriend broke up with me after we planned out our life. She was my best friend and now she's gone.. I could tell her everything and she would comfort me.. Now that we aren't together, we still tried to be friends.. I thought I could still tell her my feelings, but I was wrong.. She became annoyed and doesn't want to see me.. 

She was my everything and now I have no idea what to do.. We were together for three years and two months after she broke up with me, she moved on and is with someone else.. I feel like she never meant a thing she said and my what was left of my heart is now destroyed.. I hate what she did.. I hate that I couldn't do anything.. I hate that she made me feel things for her when she didn't feel them for me.. I feel like the only way she or anybody would miss me was if I was gone.. Like, gone gone.. I feel that would be my only relief.. 

This is my second post, but I don't feel any better..

Thanks for reading..
