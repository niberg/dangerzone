My husband's cousin committed suicide last night.

My hubby's cousin, in his early 50s attempted suicide for the third time and succeeded. 

Everyone is pissed at him except me. I get why he did it. I think when we come across people who need help everyone hopes someone else will do it. Oh, it's not my place to get involved. 

So if we all do that, than no one is helping this person. 

I understand that sometimes people refuse to be helped and/or don't want it. I don't think suicide is selfish, not every time anyway. 

This entire family has been through so much in the last little while, this is going to have some major blow back. I can think of at least two people that may have a hard time with this. 

Will the cycle continue? Or will one of us step up  and help.

Just needed to ramble.
