Looking to off myself next year. Prof is concerned. What do I do?

Life's not been great these past few years. I have come to realize I am a gigantic waste of space. Thinking of homelessness and just can't, I'd rather not be here.

I've had my exit and time planned. I kept putting it off but I can't stop going back to it.

Now I was planning for next year. Gives me time to try and pay my parents back and make peace with everyone. Problem is: I fucked up an exam real bad and left a note on the written part. Worst exam I've ever written. 

Got an email and only saw it now that prof is 'concerned'. Should I just stop showing up to that class? Class is tomorrow morning. I know I should have kept my cool with the exam and it's my fault.
