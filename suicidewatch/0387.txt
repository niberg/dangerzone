Death

Does anyone else suffer the same recurring thought of death? My mind ceases to think of something else. Every night I try to go to sleep but every night I can not. I keep thinking of which night will be my last, Where will I go once I am dead, and what is the point of continuing to live a formal lifestyle if it will just end in vain. It weighs on my mind so much that I cant stay happy. With everyone I know now gone and of the people I still know having such malicious minds what do I have to look forward to. Is this really all life has to offer just a world full of hate.
