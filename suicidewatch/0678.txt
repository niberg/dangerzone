Not sure what I should write in the title, sorry.

Please don't read this, I don't want to bother anyone with my "problems".  
I want to kill myself soon. The only reason I havn't done it yet, is because I promised someone I wouldn't do it. But promises doesn't matter when you're dead, so I'm not sure why I should care. I don't really care about anything. Except for me being bad at everything, doing everything wrong, everybody hate me, can't write proper sentences that makes sense, I'm ugly and boring. Sorry, I guess that's caring about something. Oh and I say sorry too much. I'm just a big burden for everyone and I bother everyone all the time. There is no reason for me to live. I'm going to stop eating since I don't deserve food, and now this probably seems like a troll post, I'm sorry, it's not. I'm just so depressed all the time, can't stop cutting myself, and I have no idea what to do. I guess friday would be a nice day to die. I suffer/have (not sure sorry) depression, social anxiety, eating disorder, selfharm, and probably a lot more. I'm so tired of life and everything I can't do when I see others do it without any problem. Everyone hate me almost as much as I hate myself. Wow, this text is just a big mess. I guess there's really nothing to answer here, so someone please answer something, anything? When I look at posts here I get sad, because most of them have good reasons, and I just have this mess of stuff that I should be able to handle. But I can't, and I don't want to try anymore.
