I'm incapable of feeling happiness.

I can't remember the last time I cracked a smile, or genuinely laughed without forcing myself to make other people feel better.

I am desperate for a friend, for someone to hug or at least talk to. I remember many, many years ago, all the way back in grade 6 or 7, "You used to be such a happy and uplifting kid" my mother would tell me. Then something happened, I mentally blocked most of it out, but I remember being stalked, cheated on and betrayed by people I trusted for years. 

Nowadays I feel like a bitter old man at the age of 20. I'm a terrible person, I'm a toxic shit head that only brings down other people who dare to get near me. Thoughts of ending my life constantly come to my attention. The only reason I don't kill myself is because the pain it would bring to my family.
