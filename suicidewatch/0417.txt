I wish I was dead. (Possibly a wall of text)

I want my parents and sister to treat me more like an adult but every time I show a hint of being depressed (so quite often) they restrict where I can go on my own, even when I know I won't do anything stupid.

Today I had to go to a friend's birthday party in town. I already fucked up by making us late because I got really into a game and ended up being an hour and a half late so we missed the main meal. We got there and I felt awful. My sister told me "try not to feel to miserable since it's so and so's birthday and you don't want to upset her" We were going to a pub and I felt shitty so I told my sister I wanted to go home. It would've been simple: get a train and then get a bus but she wouldn't let me because I was depressed unless she came too. I decided to stay and had to pretend to be happy. She's so selfish. It would have been best for me to go home but she didn't want me to because she would be responsible if something happened to me. And that's the whole problem with my family.

I truly believe it's best for me to die so that I can end my suffering. My family won't let me because they would feel guilt for not looking after me enough, even though it would be my decision. They are forcing me to prolong my pain, which I think is really selfish. I hate that they do that. I might even hate *them*. I don't know. It's their fault I have been suffering for such a long time because I can get it over with by killing myself.

My Dad is even emotionally blackmailing me by saying if I killed myself he would kill himself too.

You probably think I'm selfish and you're probably right but I just don't give a shit anymore.
