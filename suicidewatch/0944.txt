I don't know what to do anymore.

Hallo Honestly I don't know what to do anymore. I have never been at a low point like this before. Im already really drunk and just wanna get it over with. Im crazy in love with a girl that was my grilfriend for a long time. I Made a mistake two weeks ago and drunk Texted her some stupid shit about if she wants to fuck someone else. Since then she has Been Really Distant. I tried to Apologize and make up for it but she always said she is busy with things. I literally havent Hung out with her in 2 weeks. Honestly Id do anything for this girl. So tonight was my birthday and i went out and had a party with some friends. She came to the place at some point but was once again really Distant. I tried to talk to her but she barely answered. At the end she went home with some asshole and that's what pushed me over the edge. I started crying right there and decided to just go home. Now im just sitting here, wanting to get it over with. I dont see if there is a reason to go on anymore, this girl was everything to me.
