I just hurt everyone around me, they'll be better off in the long run

I've dealt with depression my whole life. I was diagnosed as Bipolar II a year ago. Lately all I think about is ending it. My whole life I've craved love to the point of desperation and ruin it when I do have it. I finally found someone who treats me so well and really seems to love me but he's told me that I make him feel hopeless and make him feel negative when he would normally feel positive. I've decided it's best for me to let him go so he can be happy. But it makes me even more sure that I don't deserve love. I make everyone around me feel bad and I'm just an emotional black hole. Even when I get something positive I just take it all in and give nothing back. Everyone would be better off if I was gone. I'm just a strain on everyone. I'm still deciding on how to do it but I've decided it's the right time to go. There is no light at the end of this tunnel. I'll start writing my notes tomorrow and I'm planning on ending it this weekend so I can go where my family won't find me. Even by ending it I'm hurting others. But they'll be better off in the long run.
