I hate myself

Honestly, I just fucking despise the person I am. I'm ugly as sin, overweight, and dumb as a fucking brick. I'm lazy, unmotivated, unproductive, useless, and worthless. No one around me wants me around. I've just been a burden on everyone my entire life. All of the friends I used to have won't talk to me anymore because I'm such a piece of shit that they want nothing to do with me. I'm 18, I'm in college, and I've never even kissed a girl, gotten drunk, or had any of the normal human experiences that everyone else has had by now. I thought college would be better than high school, but I have a much harder time fitting in if that's even fucking possible. I have crippling anxiety and depression, I've been trying to get help, but it's done nothing for me. The pills don't help, the counseling doesn't help, and everyday I look around and see everyone loving life and having fun. I feel physically incapable of changing myself, but I would rather die than live like this. To top it all off, all I talk about and all I want to do is just give up on life because I'm just never going to be happy. I want a way out. I don't even care about the future anymore, I don't want to have to suffer through another day just because of the impossible chance that I might not hate myself one day. I don't even think I can kill myself because I don't know how and even if I did I know I'd fuck it up like everything else I've ever done in my pathetic, miserable life.
