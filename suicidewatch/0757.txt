I suppose this is my last out reach

I feel good knowing that when I die nothing will happen. The wind will still blow, the grass will still grow. My family would probably enjoy the fact really. It gives them an excuse to get sympathy.

They never loved me, they just love drama and fighting. 

I know they never loved me, they told me enough, screamed at me none stop. My ''parents'' were the worst really, I couldn't do anything right by them, I wasn't over weight  but got me on a one meal a day type diet of small healthy foods because I'm not blessed in the looks department so they figured better to be thin as thats more wanted.

Doesn't matter if I done well in school, my parents would constantly brag about how they done better at my age how they done everything and how great they are and how shit I am.

My boyfriend. I'm not too sure he loves me, he says it, but he also calls me nasty things a lot, he cheats chronically and then says I am. I wanted so much for him to love me but I don't think he does or ever will. I broke up with someone who liked me for him, I sometimes wonder if that was foolish. 

The rest of my family?

Liars and thieves.

I don't have friends, I'm not worthy of them. 


So as you can see I'm pretty much alone in the world, it's hard to explain I have people around but I'm so lonely. 

I sleep a lot, it's the closest I can be to happy. Or at least what I think it happy, I don't remember happy it was such a long time ago I felt happy. 


I was always scared to self harm, but these past few weeks I've been doing it lightly. It's not too bad actually, in a way takes out the stress

Why am I posting here? I don't know really, last hope? I have no idea. The time is coming sooner and sooner no matter how I think about it
