I'm trapped at university and I can't get out.

I thought I had an opportunity out. There's a university in England still accepting applications for next semester abroad. My parents say the timing is bad and won't even let me apply. I don't get the chance to figure out which country I like better.

Essentially, they are okay with wasting their money at this stupidly expensive private university that I only went to because they wanted me to, and because my (now) ex-boyfriend goes here. I'm stuck without a boyfriend and at a place they think is really great. I can't get out. 

They won't let me take a leave of absence next semester. They say I have to do next semester here, and even next year. I do not even want to be in this country. I want to get out so bad and there's no way to make it happen. I'm horribly depressed and I think about dying every day. Tonight might as well be the night. I hope I'm brave enough to do it once my roommates are asleep. 

I hate being here so much. I can't believe that I don't get a chance to get out. I've done all the research. But timing is bad, and that trumps everything. I hope my parents feel a twinge of regret when I'm dead.
