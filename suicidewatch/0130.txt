My little brother tried to commit suicide, I need advice

I posted in /r/advice but I just discovered this subreddit and I think I can find more specific help here. Last night I got a text from my mom at about 11:30 that my brother had tried to hang himself and is now in a psych ward. I live 400 miles away, I'm 2.5 years into my bachelor's degree, and I miss my brother like crazy right now. I can't belive he tried this and I am so sad that he has feelings like this. I love him so much. 


Now for some backstory. My brother is a freshman in high school and has been having trouble ever since my parents (lesbians) divorced 5 years ago. His grades are bad and he's given up on homework, also he had some incidents where he hit some bullies who were calling him names. And for the past 2 months he's ran away from home to the park nearby. Despite all this behavior, he is incredibly good and seemingly happy when he gets to visit me. He apparently misses me a lot and has said to his therapist that he feels like he doesn't have a male role model or figure in his life (I am male but I'm 400 miles away). Oh, and he is also on medication for ADHD and bipolar disorder. 


What I need help with is this: what the heck do I do? Do I call or text him? (Assuming he has access to a phone). Should I pretend I don't know what happened so he's not embarrassed? My brother and I get along very well and have identical hobbies and interests, but I've never talked to him about feelings, it all feels weird.  What should I do? :(
