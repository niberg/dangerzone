I feel trapped

I've failed uni, can't find a job, got other paying my rent for me and I feel stuck. I have nowhere to move to at all, no one to take me in. My life is going nowhere and doing nothing. Realizing I was starting to feel cut off I started trying to socialize a little more, but most my friends in the city have turned against me as someone spread malicious rumors about me. Then there's my home. The only place I can live, someone else is crashing with us and I'm the only person to have an issue with her. Any suggestion I make she openly argues with and everyone takes her side. Anything I want to do she moves to block and everyone takes her side. I hear her openly bitching to the others about me (she has a big mouth and very thin walls) and not one person is willing to defend me.

I feel like I'm trapped in my on room, a room she's been given permission to just walk into by my girlfriend, a girlfriend that gets mad at me if i bring any of this up. I'm trapped with nowhere to call mine, no money, no friends and starting to think I have only one ay out
