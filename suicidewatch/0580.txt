13 year old struggling with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.

I am constantly thinking about death or suicide, I never leave my room, I get bullied at school, I'm fat, I have only one or two friends who are actually good friends back to me. I'm socially awkward, my parents constantly say they will get help but never do, I get grounded for panic/anger/confusion attacks (I kick and scream during these, and my parents think I'm just being immature), I'm a atheist in a catholic school, I'm only good at geeky things (I am a self admitted geek, but being a geek gets me bullied). All if these thing make me feel depressed as all hell, It is almost impossible for me to be happy, I have constant thoughts of suicide and when it gets really bad I may punch my shoulders till I'm bruised. I'm trying desperately not to start cutting or commit suicide. To make things worse some kid took my phone at school and looked through all my music, they say my many chemical romance and green day albums which are considered very emo at my school. So now I have people telling me to kill myself and that I'm a emo fag who should just die, people roll up my sleeves in the hall to see if I cut just to be a dick... I don't even act that emo, that's just the music I enjoy... I need help, what can I do?
