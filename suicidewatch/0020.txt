I don't know what else to try

Excuse my language throughout, but I am 100% fed the FUCK up with being told to call this or that other hotline. I have nobody to talk to in real life. My only recourse is the internet where I try to find out about other people's struggles and maybe make sense of my own. All I find is the same goddamn cookie-cutter response of "call 1-800-useless". Telling me to call some fucking anonymous hotline helps exactly ZERO percent. I've gone to a doctor. I got put on meds. They made it worse. Changed meds, same shit. What the fuck else can I do?? I feel like there's no recourse. The helplessness is suffocating. I don't know where to turn. Nothing has helped. Is this really it? Is this the best it's going to get? I can't even do my fucking job anymore. I feel paralyzed. And I'm terrified that it's going beyond depression. I'm terrified I'm losing my grip on my sanity. I don't expect replies here. I've heard it all, and while it's well-intentioned and appreciated, there's not a single thing anybody has said to me that could help this situation. I feel like one of those people born without a vital part of their brain. What kind of life is that to lead?

Currently downing Xanax and alcohol. I know there's a slim chance of this actually killing me, but it's all I can muster...
