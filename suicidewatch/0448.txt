Just did this to keep myself from impulsively committing suicide

I have been depressed for a few years now, and have thought often . About suicide. Today I took my pistol a single bullet, a flash of whiskey and a pack of smokes and a . Picture of my loved one, out it in a water proof container and buried it deep in the Rockies. Now if I decide to kill myself I'll have to deliberately find and dig up my own death. I feel better already. If anyone wants to talk pm me and I will be happy to chat, thru r e d dit or Skype. Remember, u can always do it tomorrow. I love.e you.
