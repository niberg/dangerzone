Tonight

I found just this week that the guy I love, the one who keot me going with the distant hope that the feelings were mutual, is not who I thought he was. I have been used and manipulated for the last time. It has become clear to me that the only reasons people want me around are self-serving ones. My one source of joy has become my greatest pain, and this is the final time that I allow it to happen. If all goes as I hope, I will be gone by morning.
