I cant do this anymore, I really cant

Every morning I wake up and it takes me 30 mins to move out of bed. I shout at myself to move but my body doesnt listen. I didn't shower this morning before work because I took too long. I've also got into the process of not eating breakfast. Quick comb, put something small for dinner in my lunchbox (today it was a single donut), clothes on quick and then im done. About 10 mins. Then its on the bus to work.

At work I am constantly feeling depressed and my mind keeps thinking horrible things, what ifs and the like. My work colleagues think im ill from an ear infection (what I told them when I had 2 days off due to being so ill with my depression). I go along with it but I cant smile and I wont talk much at work. I also run to the bathroom to cry to myself in the cubicle. 

I then get the bus home, this is where I cry the most. I just feel terrible. I get home and then its crying some more as I try to find ways to feel less lonely and to calm my head. Right now is the horrible night period. I cant get myself to stop and I hate crying. I want this to stop. I have medication and im seeing a psyciatrist soon but I hate this lonliness so much..... Im starting to feel suicidal.
