Killing myself is inevitable, so enjoy the limited time I have left?

I really believe that killing myself is inevitable and will probably take place within the next couple of years (I'm 30). I see absolutely no way out of my situation. I have been long-term unemployed and lonely (finally found a great guy who lives far away but can't be with him because I am apparently too messed up to even get hired anywhere) for years, in spite of getting sober, in spite of losing 100 pounds, in spite of getting a Master's degree, in spite of trying to be a nice person, in spite of years of therapy and medication. I was thinking tonight, though, that if I'm going to end up killing myself anyway, maybe I can at least try to enjoy the limited time I have left instead of just spending every single day depressed and not wanting to do a damn thing. The problem is that I don't even know what I'd enjoy. Has anyone else thought about taking this approach though? What did you do to enjoy yourself? Has it helped at all?
