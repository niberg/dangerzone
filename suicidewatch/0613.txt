I'm so fucking bitter. I hate her.

I should be dead right now. I should have blasted my brains out last Friday like I had planned. I should have gotten what I wanted for once. But she ruined it. She took what I wanted away from me. AGAIN. I'm so tired of all this shit. I should be gone right now and I'm not. It just makes me angry at her for stopping it all from happening. And it's not like she stopped it altogether. It's just delayed. So now because of her I need to suffer for a few more months because I'm way too superstitious about planning this all out carefully to do it before then. Fuck you.
