My life is over

A few years ago I was curious about having sex with another man so I responded to a craigslist ad and met up with a guy. We told each other we were clean and he knew it was my first time with a guy and we got into it. I sensed that he didnt put on a condom but I guess I'm just too timid for confrontation. He didnt pull out. In less than a week I got flulike syptoms and did some research that it might be hiv. I contacted him and he told me that he was going to get a checkup and andre event adventures eventually it came back negative. So I kinda stowed it away in the back of my mind and didnt think about it until recently when I started a serious relationship with my gf. I got one of those tests you can mail in and it came back positive. I was going to kill myself then but I read somewhere that false positives happen so I decided to go into a doctors office for a full std test. I just got a call back from the doctors and let it go to voicemail. I'm too afraid to answer back. The past couple of weeks have been just wreckless. I quit my job recently  and have been smoking and drinking a ton just to keep my mind off it. If when I call back it turns out positive I'm gonna kill myself. I wanted to kill the guy too but I doubt I have the stomach for it. You make so many plans in life. A good job. Meeting someone that makes you happy. Having kids. I'm only 24 and now my chances for a family are ruined if not completely gone. Even worse is the thought that I'll never be able to have sex again. At least not without the crushing fear that I'll infect someone. And all because I didnt have the balls to confront this guy. I know that people live long lives with hiv now but whats the point. Itll be a close guarded secret. The stigma around it is too much to bear. As soon as I tell people their perceptions of me will change. I cant handle it. Thank god I havent had sex with my gf yet.
