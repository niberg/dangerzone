How I can be there for my sister?

My sister's primary Dr called my mom Thurs to ask her to escort my sis to the hospital for a few days observation (she is 59 and has been hospitalized for depression before)  because she spoke of suicide.  My mom spent the day at the hosp with her but found out the next morning that my sis had checked out (her health deductible is $6,000 and her family can't afford that).  Mom got her the name/phone of a psychiatrist whom she will see tomorrow (Monday). I am across the country but I want to be present for her in any way I can -  I am looking for some guidance on how I may speak with her and let her know she is loved/supported.  I texted her but not surprised she hasn't responded.  I plan to call today. 
Thank you!
