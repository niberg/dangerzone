Today, I wrote a note.

A note of my farewells to my loved ones. I was crying the entire time, but once I got to the part saying goodbye to my younger cousins, that probably won't understand whats going on when it happens, I was bawling my eyes out. I am crying right now. I can't even think about leaving them in this world. I love my family too much. But is that a valid reason to stay? I could run away, I could kill myself, I could "get lost" on my families next vacation. Who knows. I can't just say goodbye to them, it hurts to much to know that I am hurting them. Yet I can't go without a goodbye or farewell or reasoning. The only person I feel comfortable talking to about this is my friend yet, shes going to sleep. So I can't text her. I'm alone in this world, I'd say no one knows how I feel but I know that's not true. The only thing that made me happy in the past year was when I saw someone that I haven't seen in years and he pointed out that I was in much better shape and he was proud, that made me happy. And when I was talking to this girl I think is really cute she said I was cute. but I'm not happy enough to want to stay. I wish i could get a 'teaser' or a 'demo' of what it would be like, what it would feel like, and how people would feel &amp; act, who'd actually cry? I don't know.
