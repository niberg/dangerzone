Tired of living a life of cowardliness &amp; lies.

After the years of mental abuse I had to go through that forged me into the coward &amp; liar that I am today, I'm finally done with it.

At age 29, I cannot pursue this life and simply cannot accept my past.

All I ever wanted was to have a normal childhood with no abuse.

Goodbye world, I wish I was normal enough to leave something positive. 

May God bless the soul of my abusers.
