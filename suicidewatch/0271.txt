I want to leave this awful world

I thought God loves us all or whatever, and for the past 4 months, i've tried to stick with that shit that it gets better. I know my problems sound stupid, but it's whats destroying me from the inside. My friends forgot about me in the past i cant trust them, ive been excluded because people in my classes are better friends with each other than me. The biggest thing is i lost the best girl ill ever have and i know i can't do better. Im so ugly and boring. I can't do it anymore reddit.
