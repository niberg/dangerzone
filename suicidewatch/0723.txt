i feel like it's my duty to the world to somehow publicly announce that i am a piece of crap. i try to distance myself from my friends, smile when i see them and not talk too much, but they still hate when I'm around. i've said i'll kill myself so many times that i guess obsessive liar is another trait i can add to my list. i ran out of space on my hands to count the people who have said that the world will be a better place without me.

i've been waiting so long for my grandparents to die. that's what everyone tells me. "your grandparents wouldn't be able to handle it." so i've just sat here for years telling people i'm happy and smiling. counselors and doctors find ways to ditch me continually. and i don't blame them in the least.

look at me, this mopey piece of crap that deserves to die. a "friend" is coming over, so i have to go smoke pot and pretend to be happy.
