What would people do?

I'm starting to think a lot more about death. And as I think about it, I wonder what people would do if I died. Would they react differently to suicide than just a freak accident that killed me? What would my girlfriend do? What about my friends? My family? Teachers? Classmates that I don't know? The media? I'm really starting to wonder. I'm scared. I don't want to. But every day I become less and less happy and more and more curious. I used to be excited about the future. Now I'm scared and stressed. I used to enjoy the company of my girlfriend and my friends. Now I don't want to talk to anybody. Sometimes I try to avoid my girlfriend because I just don't feel like talking to people. I think she knows something is up, but I doubt she'll say anything. I don't even enjoy hanging out with my 2 best friends anymore. We used to have so much fun. Now I just feel like I drag it all down. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to kill myself. I'm not to the point of serious suicidal thought yet, but every day I spend a little more time thinking and wondering about death.
