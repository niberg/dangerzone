Everything just feels so difficult

I can't do it anymore, even the most mundane tasks feel monumental and I'm giving myself a headache thinking about it. 

It's taken me two hours to sit up in bed. My mum keeps nagging at me to do the ironing, tidy my room, do my uni work. How can I? My head hurts, I feel like I've taken a huge step back. 

What's the point in trying to get better when you slip back so easily? My SO is trying to help and send me ideas of things to help but I don't WANT to help myself. 

The longer I leave my work, the more upset and stressed I get. I don't do my work because I'm already upset and stressed. There's an obvious way to end it but I don't do it. It's pathetic. 

My tutor's been waiting four days for this work. I don't have an excuse, I'm just lazy and sad and pathetic. I feel like I'm reaching the end of my life, there's nothing more after this.
