I've been drinking and want to drive

I just got into a big fight with my best friend because he refuses to tell me anything going on with him so when he has a mental breakdown I'm left out in the fucking dark. We had a massive heart to heart but it solved nothing and I'm sitting here thinking not only about how my friendship is fucked but also about the other shit that makes my life not happy. I've got a bottle of wine in front of me and my car downstairs.
