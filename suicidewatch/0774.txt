Falling apart at the seams

I just need to get some words out. Everything's falling apart. It's been five years since I started getting treated for depression. I barely made it through college. I was totally isolated in a shitty backwards rural town, and then finally I was free. I got into grad school and things were looking up. I'm now in a big city, away from the terrible homophobic places I've lived.

But now it's all crumbling around me.

I'm only in the first semester of my grad program, and things are shit. I'm doing terrible in half my classes, and am facing the concern of getting kicked out of my program for being below the 3.5 GPA requirement. I spend 60 hours a week on homework, but I don't understand anything. My old depression medications stopped working, so I'm going through a transition, but I keep questioning what the point is. Not to mention that in addition to coursework, I have to still find time to suck up to other grad students in the department so I can get into a decent lab. I've already most likely lost out on two groups I really wanted to be in, because the others who wanted it are happy and congenial and fun to be around; I hate them. i don't have time to play these games or have fun, and I just don't have the will to fight anymore. I've always had passive suicidal thoughts, but they're getting more active than just thinking how much I wish I were dead. I can't stop crying, I can't eat, and I can't do anything as well as I used to. I've considered getting medical leave, but I can't afford rent without my grad student stipend, so I have to wait for either my dismissal from the program and/or the day I finally decide to end things myself.

My ambition's gone. My friends are non-existent. My parents are out of my life. I have no one but my therapist. And I'm just so tired..
