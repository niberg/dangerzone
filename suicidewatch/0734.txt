Help me please with a friend

I don't know if this belongs here, because it's not about me.

An internet friend of mine has cut herself and lost a couple of litres of blood. She told me she was suicidal for a long time but now she actually slit her wrists but didn't die. She has borderline personality disorder, and I always thought she said the suicidal things to prevent me from leaving or something. I did take it serious, but now that she made an attempt and failed, what do I tell her?
