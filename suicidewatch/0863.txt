Plan to die soon, what have I missed?

Depression has finally kicked me over the edge. A long story short, the person I love is not with me, and has not been with me for eight years now. I've tried to console to others about my feelings, only to be told I'm selfish, I guess they are right.

I finished writing my will today. It's not legally binding, but to be honest it does not have to be. I expect that my family and friends will follow it to the letter, I will be donating my remaining bank balance to a Cancer charity in the following week in honour of a old friend who passed away a few years ago. I have also complied a list of songs I wished to be played at my funeral that represents my character.

In the will I have wrote what personal possessions I want to go to whom, and what I want to be donated. I have left messages to each of my friends and family, and left each person I care deeply about a personal gift. 

I am going to be meeting up with my closest friends for one last time this week, although they have no idea this is the last time.

To be honest, I'm still not sure how I'm going to do it. There is a rather large, steep cliff on the sea front that looks good, it's pretty much a vertical drop and the drop is rather long. It's either that or walking into the sea, I can't swim for shit and I once got washed away, maybe this time it will take me completely.

Edit: Here is the will in its current form. Naturally I have taken out names that may help identify me.





My Will





This is the will of ____________, born ___________. Please find below items that are to be left to those of my choosing and messages to each of them. Any items not found on this list are to be destroyed unless specifically stated. I expect everything below to be honoured and followed to the letter.

Please do not allow any religious ceremony’s to take place at my funeral. I will state it here, I do not believe in God and I never have, I am a anti-theist by nature. I have not gone to a better place, or fallen into some pit of hell, this was the only place I have or will ever exist. If you truly wish to honour my memory, do so by remembering those moments we shared together. For those who are in pain know this, sooner or later I would have taken my own life. While I do not believe in god, to a certain extent I do believe in fate. It was fate that drove me down this path of self-destruction. I am a __________, and above all else we are stubborn, prideful and refuse to accept help from others. This coupled with my emotions led me here, and even without these things effecting me, I would never let death take me on its terms, I will go when I please.

At the time of writing this, I am still undecided on how I shall die, but I imagine it will be rather dramatic.

If you are unsure as to how to do this, please ask ____ for assistance.

All electrical equipment required for the internet connection will of course be kept in its place unless you need to move it.

Here is the poem I wrote for my ex, this will be delivered to her house anonymously after my death:



The Angel

by _____________

An angel stands upon a shore,

surveying all he sees.

A wreck's amongst the rubble,

a survivor's way out at sea.

He tries to save what little's left,

the waves, they're just too strong.

She floats away beyond his sight,

that treasures far too gone.

And now he knows all hope is gone,

this angels all alone.

He looks around for someone else,

alas, he's on his own.

Angels only ever die,

when their lovers gone.

This angel, try all he might,

he cannot carry on.
