F17, depression gets worse and worse

Hello everyone,
I try to keep the text short...
Since several years, I struggle with all kinds of psychological issues. I've attempted suicide, been through an eating disorder, cutted myself etc.
I was in therapy a few years ago and they fixed me up and everything but now it is so horrible again :( I see my psycho-therapist once a week but always with my mum so I can't really speak freely. In one or two weeks Ihave a stationary therapy for a few month but there is a problem: I have a bipolar disorder which is incurable. They can tread me with different kinds of therapy (talking, horses, music, ...) but in the end (lets just face it) it won't go away and honestly, I don't want to spend my life being on drugs to get along. Plus, I can't go to school or to work because I am too depressed to get up in the morning and every social contact freaks me out a bit. My future is black without education and I am sure I will never make someone proud of me.
I get sleeping pills at the moment because I rarely sleep at all and when I do, I have bad nightmares.
Everything feels horrible, sometimes I just break down in tears and don't know why (just like this moment), I feel like nobody really cares (my boyfriend isn't really worried and my dad says things like "depression is like a headache, just take some pills and relax, it will go away"). I just feel so alone and misunderstood and since a few weeks I think about... yeah, killing myself. I just can't deal with this all anymore.
