I just feel like im suffering

I literally hate my life, i hate school its feels like a waste of time, i dont have many friends as much as i try, i never fit in, it feels like my personality is too different. Ive been with three women in the past 6 months and all three ive gotten cheated on and i did nothing wrong to deserve it and that has to be the worst feeling in the world. I just feel useless and seriously hope i just dont wake up one day. I cant take life anymore i want out of it. I try to better myself and yet i just keep feeling worse. Theres nothing i can do. Ill probly just down a whole thing of pills soon. Help me please
