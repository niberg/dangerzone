Letting go of life

I came on here and spilled my life story and got 2 responses so I'll keep this short as possible.

Birthday is on Monday, my 21st. I spent a large part of my 20th thinking that 20 years has been enough for me. This last year has been the hardest year of my life emotionally, watched everything fall apart. My situation with my now ex girlfriend went awry on the 20th of November, we broke up in April and she's still wreaking havoc on my life.

Every aspect of my life hurts at this point, letting go of the pain would be forgetting about everyone..but I'm only alive for the people who "care" about me and have hurt me immensely at this point.

I have goals but they don't mean much to me anymore..I have a plan in mind but it isn't in place fully yet. I'm thinking I may throw a birthday party next weekend and see most of my close family and friends one last time.. I wish I could be honest and tell them what I want to do but I know better.

I wish they understood that dying has become the only thought that comforts me, the only thing I feel optimism about. I just want to let go of all this pain, this anger, this lack of trust.. The feelings of hatred towards most everybody who's claimed to care about me the most. I don't have the means to die this weekend but I will figure it out.. I don't have a better option.
