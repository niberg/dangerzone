I feel so useless

So my grandmother who has been there with me my entire life growing up broke her hip and is in the hospital. There is a 1/3 chance she could die from the surgery. She is 85. To add to this my mom's boyfriend is sexting other women. My mom is broken down and isn't happy. It's even worse because he made her happy after my parents split up. To give more of a backstory, my dad is an ok guy but he made a mistake and came home drunk one night and beat her so they split up. I'm watching family memebers die both physically and mentally and there's nothing I can do about it. I am feeling pain that I cannot even begin to describe and I feel so useless. I need help.Fuck it I'm done with life...
