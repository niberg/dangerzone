Help me help my wife?

Hi everyone, I'm suicidal but I am actually here because of my concern for my wife who might be suicidal. 

She has said that she will 'follow me' if I kill myself and regardless of how I end up, I really don't want this for her. We're in polar opposite situations and she has the rest of her life to find another person to fall in love and marry. 

We're in an open relationship and she has a secondary who I know can take of her, as well as a network of friends and family. My wife is seeing a doctor and is on citalopram which has been relieving (some) of her symptoms. She has been working while I go to school. What can I do to make sure she gets through this difficult time?

I appreciate any suggestions and advice, as long as they are aimed at taking care of her and not me. Thanks. :)
