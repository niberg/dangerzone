I just don't feel like living anymore

I don't know if I want to die. But i just don't know how I can live anymore. Over the past month I've ruined my entire life and future. I'm too depressed to do anything. I don't make it to class anymore, I havent done laundry in weeks, my hygiene has gone to shit. I don''t talk to most of my friends anymore.I'm starting to pick up a drinking problem. I just lay around in my room and do nothing. I feel so numb and nauseous all the time. Nothing feels real anymore. I still haven't attempted yet, but I'm getting closer and closer. I just can't go on living like this. But I don't have any other way out to escape.
