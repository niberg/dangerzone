Is suicide my only option?

Within the past three months, I have lost everything I have ever cared about. I got into a great college on the condition that my test scores improve, then had my acceptance revoked because my most recent scores were no better than my previous ones, even though I studied hard every day. My parents are throwing me out of the house when I turn 18, and I have no money for food or shelter, and no means of finding a job that pays enough to live off of. The boy I love told me after 5 years that he will never feel as strongly for me as I feel for him. My friends all hate me and ignore me because I spent too much of my time on school and my boy and not enough time on them. I lost my dance team captainship last week when I broke my ankle. I have no future and no one who cares for me. I have a history of anorexia, and am relapsing currently and I don't know how to make it stop. I've been beginning to think that suicide is my only option out. If there is no one to care for you and miss you in this life, then what is the point of living? I'm not sure that I truly want to die, I just feel that I have no other choices. I miss feeling loved and cared for by others, and don't think I can take care of myself for much longer. I've tried talking to counselors and therapists, but their answers and options seem fake and overly optimistic. Where do I turn from here?
