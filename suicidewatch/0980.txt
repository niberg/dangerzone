Suicidal Ideation at work

Whenever I feel down, I keep getting graphic suicidal ideas at work, and pinning the blame on the person making me feel like this (my boyfriend mostly, but can also be friends, family..). It feels like the suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more persistent and thought out, and I don't know what to do. There isn't anyone I can talk to about this. This is very hugely taboo where I live and I'm becoming exhausted. I've been picturing myself jumping out the bathroom window since this morning.... Please help.
