I don't know if this is appropriate, but I want to thank this community for support when I needed it - it's been three years since my last post...

I don't know if it's cool to post this kind of thing here, so if mods want to delete it that's cool, I won't be indignant or nothing, you guys have a standard to maintain. Consider it a long-in-the-making [Update] thread.

I was kind of inspired by [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2lrdh1/whats_the_worst_experience_on_reddit_youve_had_so/clxf8kw) to look back, and give a tiny bit back in gratitude what I got three years ago, at the height of my depression and loneliness, and the time of my one real suicide attempt. I want to say thank you to this community. Then it just kept getting longer, and, well, sorry about that, I guess I just have some sappy self-absorbed feelings to get out.

I posted twice, under two different throwaway accounts:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m7a35/i_dont_think_im_cut_out_to_exist/

At the time, I didn't follow up with anybody who'd sent me an encouraging message, because, well, I dunno, I was embarrassed, insecure, generally fucked up, and probably wouldn't have been able to make anyone feel like progress was being made since there weren't a lot of positive developments going on in my life at the time. Now, that feels a bit like a faux pas, especially since a couple of the accounts are deleted, so it's unlikely I'll be able to personally extend them any thanks.

I was desperately confused, angry, alienated and generally twisted up in despair. I didn't know anyone like me, and I was in far too much pain to risk opening up a little to the people passing by to see if they might be a little like me. I didn't know how to deal with my gender dysphoria, and having just that month moved out for the first time from the Catholic household in the prairie I'd grown up in I didn't have any resources to fall back on to deal with it.

It took a long, long time before any of that got better. By the end of 2012, a whole year later, I moved away from the prairie and the friend group there I quickly came to realize had been toxic and generally unhealthy for me. By the end of 2013 I was finally out as trans to the world and coming to accept myself - marked pretty well by the day I marched in Vancouver's Pride parade. And it took until a couple months ago for me to find people who are actually attracted to me for who I am, and to begin to love and accept not only myself but my body, and those are two things which I honestly figured would never happen. I am honestly happier now than I could ever have imagined being three years ago. I'm about to graduate, finally, with no failed classes on my record despite any bitching about academics, I work at a mental health NGO that does amazing work and treats me really well as an employee, I'm going to move out to the place of my dreams in a couple months, transitioning fucking rules, I'm confident, happy, loquacious, I named my new puppy Arya - life really turned around.

Posting here wasn't a turning point, or the big hand that lifted me up, but it was one of few hands that did in those days. It was a way to vent, and be heard in a safe environment, really the only outlet I had for a while, and I appreciate everyone who took the time to post.

I don't want to turn this into some facile 'It gets better' message, because for a long time, it might not. Even after that post, my life involved a long series of ups and downs, false starts to transitioning and happiness and stability and acceptance, betrayals and drama and failure, and while I'm not sure it ever got worse than I was in 2011, when it really did get bad enough that I tried to end it all, there were definitely times I was just as hopeless. I didn't end up on the medication I needed (which for me was just hormones) until March of *this year*. It was a long road, and I'm slightly surprised I kept deciding to live through it all, but I'm glad I did.

I guess, I don't know - if you've ever been in a place of total despair, you know that things can get worse than you ever imagined, and no matter what anyone says about the bottom it can always get worse. Well, that's true, but things can also always get better. I believed, for a long time, that I was just pre-destined to be unhappy, to feel ugly, that it was deficient brain chemistry, malfunctioning algorithms inside me that would haunt me no matter how many days I suffered through for the benefit of others. Now I know, in fact, that that was bullshit, I can in fact be happy as shit. The past three years, personally, have been a vindication for me of a dumb internet cliche saying that I used to hate, 'Before you diagnose yourself as depressed, make sure you're not just surrounded by assholes.' I used to think that was snide and served to erase real mental illness. Maybe I still do. 

But then again I studied philosophy which would teach us that the highest happiness is to be found in the realm of the mind and I instead eventually found it in somebody who thought I was hot, so I guess I should just accept that life is about adjusting to irony (and if any of you are suffering through romantic loneliness, that really is the roughest. But if I as a spergy prairie tranny can do it, by God, sir or madam, you can do it).

So, if you're depressed and you find any twinge of recognition in those things I posted, keep fighting. Life is stupid and absurd enough that sometimes really good things happen, and much like bad things, sometimes they seem to happen to you in particular for no goddamn reason at all. If you really need it, I'm also available to talk, though that isn't the main reason I posted this - I made a note in my original post about always being the supported rather than the supportive, and I'm glad to say I think I'm on the other end of the equation these days. I'm really far from being a professional about any of this stuff (I mean I work in mental health so technically I'm a professional, but I'm an HR and admin gal, I don't work with clients) but I guess I know some thought patterns and strategies that worked for me.

And if you're one of the angels who posts here to try to support people, to offer words of encouragement, know that at least sometimes when someone you're trying to help doesn't follow up, drops off the face of the Earth, whatever, it's just because they need time to find their own way to healing, so try not to let that get to you.

And if you're any one of /u/natedogg89 , /u/Indi008 , /u/anmitsu , or even an owner of the seemingly inactive accounts /u/pbjay , /u/transitlife , or /u/ambidextrous_handjob , thank you, so much, you beautiful human being.

I guess I should stop before I become even more insufferably delighted with myself. Sorry, again, both for not getting back to you guys earlier about what a useful place this is and for making such a big production of it now.
