please someone help me until i can feel comfortable going to the hospital.

i have no one i feel comfortable talking to right now. i don't want to burden anyone and i'm a huge fucking waste of space burden. i want to live though. i do. i want to fucking fix this. i want to be happy and healthy. i want to give a shit. but unless i have something other than me and my demons until 6ish today i just might kill myself.
