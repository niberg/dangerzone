Flawed methods of help here

Being ripped away from one's life into a psych ward is nothing other than damaging. The patient's outside life is left to crumble as it naturally would if anyone stopped leaving their house or communicating with others. Furthermore, patients will be treated like deluded nothings while their care-not staff think they're sane as they read their bible on lunch break. They might have a few staff who aren't vindictive, but what does that matter? They know their patients can't afford meds after discharge.

Mental health treatment is hard to come by in the USA. Insurance is expensive and discriminatory because cost/profit.

It's dangerous to pursue mental health treatment while admitting to suicidal tendencies or ideation. Being committed will ruin a person's life and negate the temporarily free drugs (i.e. avoiding creditors).

Once a person is out or decides to help their self, then what? If they're on their own, with no certs, they can hope for a job where they're paid shit, treated like shit; and if they please their masters by working their self to death, they'll still be kicked to the curb at the slightest provocation.

Why live a slave constantly raped of produced value? This sub's rules are unrealistic by denying practical resolutions that only steer people towards living in and learning to live shitty, fucked conditions.
