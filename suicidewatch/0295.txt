I am going to lay down on the tracks by my house tomorrow.

Title. I think I will shoot myself as the train comes by too. I am going to cover myself with a blanket so the conductor doesn't have to see.  I read that was a nice thing to do. I am a 17 year old male and I live with a lot of chronic pain due to a disease and I'm not really sure why I'm writing about it here. I guess I'm hoping I can get some support. I have very little motivation to do much so when I try to talk about my issues with my family they think I am not serious or am lying. My lack of motivation has caused me to fall behind in school and  that has led to lots of anger and shaming in my household. I've also become incredibly mean to my closest friends and family but I think I have been that way my entire life anyways. Hopefully I won't be mean to anyone any longer. I wrote this on my phone so I hope it is coherent.
