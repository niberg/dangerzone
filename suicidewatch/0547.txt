Same old, some old. Any advice?

Can't afford therapy. Screwed myself over in my current job after believing that I could pursue something else (needless to say, that something else apparently didn't work out, as I was supposed to hear back from the job I was pursuing a few days ago and still haven't heard a peep). I've struggled with depression the entirety of my adult life, but I've never been in a place this bad for so long before. No one close to me understands, and I have no one else that I can reach out to. I have bills to pay and college tuition that I'm handling entirely on my own, and the only way that I can make money is through a field that I absolutely loathe. I have passions that I want to do something with, but I don't have time to do anything with them. I am in a very tight, very claustrophobic tunnel right now, it feels, and I can see a very, very distant light, but I can't move an inch to get to it. 

I really, really cannot do this anymore. I can barely get out of bed in the mornings, and I have no energy for anything or anyone. What can I do? What should I do? 

I don't want to go over the edge, but I don't feel as though I have much of a choice. I want to go to sleep for a very, very long time, and never wake up. Any advice? Is there a way out of this that I'm just not seeing?
