How to keep going with no hope

I've been sick the last year, and doctors still don't know what's wrong.  Some tests have come out with odd readings, and no one is giving me answers or trying to look further.  Just more referrals to different doctors, more "I don't know what's going on", and more disappointment.  It's been this way for months.  I've just given up.

Waking up every day is the same.  I know after sleeping for 12+ hours, I'll still feel tired.  My fingers ache, and my neck is swollen.  I get random migraines, and sometimes I'll feel sick to my stomach.  I have rashes on my legs that come and go.  The list goes on and on.

The research I've done show that my test results point to either lymphoma or sarcoidosis - but the one endocrinologist I went to was fresh out of med school and said he "had to do research as to what can cause high calcitrol levels".  Never got a call back.  

A month ago, I found out I was pregnant.  I was worried because of my health issues, but thought to myself "well at least something good is happening with my body".  My fiance was so happy; I was so happy.  Then I had a miscarriage on Friday.  The fucking doctors at the ER didn't even do an ultrasound, even after explaining my family has a history of ectopic pregnancies and I'd like one.  Just "oh it'll just come out naturally".  I'm even more worried that whatever underlying illness was the cause of this.  I'm not even willing to try again, because I know damn well I can't go through this again.

I feel like I'm dealing with idiots.  I live in a rural area and the medical care is...not really up to par.  My life has become debilitating.  I just can't go on anymore.  Every day I wish for either an answer or not to wake up.  

I'm so tired of all of it.
