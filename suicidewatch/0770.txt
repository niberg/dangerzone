What am I doing...

I hate my life. School is getting the better of me and I'm scared about the future. I'm only 15 and sometimes I just feel like everything is against me and life is only going to get tougher along the way. I wake up every single morning wishing I'd died in my sleep. I'm too scared to talk to my family members about my problems I'm scared they'll judge me, give me that it'll get better speech. I feel like a useless blemish on this planet, I won't contribute anything to society. I feel like no one likes me. The people I call my friends make fun of me all the time because of my skin tone. They call me names, but its either them or being alone. I'm scared of being alone. I'm scared of what people think of me. I think about it all the time. I feel their stares and I don't know what to do. I feel like this whole world is against me and my dreams. I just want to be happy again. I want my family to be happy. My father recently choked my mother and nothing has been the same since. Everything between us is awkward and no matter what I do I can't seem to bring myself to look at him straight in the eyes.  Sometimes I just feel that suicide is my only escape. I feel like whatever is on the other end can't nearly be as bad as this. I know that many people may have it worse, but I just always feel sad.
