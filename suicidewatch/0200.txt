I just tried it.

My wife had a huge argument right before I did. She's leaving me.

Well I did it, I probably shouldn't be on the computer such short time after.

I guess I passed out and it slipped from around my neck. Woke up, and now my head hurts. My wife isn't answering the phone, and I am too much of a pussy to try again. 

Idk what to do.

I'm 20 years old
I've got no family around anymore, no friends where i live. No one I can go to.

I wish I would've told someone other than my wife.

I've tried the hotlines, I nevere actually got ahold of someone. Longest hold time was 2 hours.
