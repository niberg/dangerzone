Knowing that ending my life isn't a good solution just worsens my depression

Been suffering from depression for quite awhile. I had it diagnosed last year.

Even with medication and therapy, I still have my depressive episodes, like the one I'm in right now.

I was doing pretty well up until about a week ago, when things just went to shit mentally again.

I know there are gonna be times when I don't have depressive episodes and there are gonna be times when I do. I just don't see the point in living if I'm gonna be living like this for the rest of my life. Sure there's gonna be the good parts, but there's ALWAYS gonna be those depressive parts that come along with it. I want to end my life, but knowing that I won't be here anymore and the effect it will have on everyone I know is keeping me from doing it. But then that just makes my depression worse, knowing that there is no easy way out. I just want to stop suffering. It's come to a point where even though I'm aware of the effect it will have on everybody and how I won't be here anymore, I still don't give a shit.
