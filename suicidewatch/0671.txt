I don't even know anymore..

I'm 17 years old and I feel like a total degenerate. Ever since I was little, I had little to no friends and never really anyone that I could relate to with myself. I love my family but I just feel like I can't really tell anyone my emotions. I am in college now and I just feel like no one really likes me even though I try my hardest to make friends with them. I also tell lies just to boost my self-confidence such as I have had sex, gotten drunk loads of times and had a long term relationship with someone. I just feel completely out of place and I feel like that kid who just tries to relate with everyone but doesn't know what they are talking about. I just hate myself in general and I wish someone could please talk to me.
