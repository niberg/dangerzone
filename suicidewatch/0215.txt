Worst night in my life for no reason

I'm a 22 year old male. I have faced depression and anorexia for most of my adult life. I'm an exchange student and I don't know who to turn to; I fear that if I say too much I will be sent back to my country but that will not help the situation. I want help but I don't know how to get it and I feel like there's no time. I have not been able to work as I should. I have not been eating properly for a while, I don't sleep, I don't leave the house much except when I have class. I had not noticed the symptoms and I should have, as I'm a psych student. I have tried everything, but I can't stop the thoughts of ending my life. I already broke down crying three times. Even if I get better I'm going to fail everything. I don't know if I should tell my teachers and if they would understand, I don't want to take advantage of my situation. Please help me, anyone, I don't know what to do.
