I don't think I can go back to work.

I need some help :( I try so hard to hide my depression. Nobody in my life even knows how much I just want to end the suffering. Everyone always tells me how much of a happy child I was, always laughing and making people happy. They tell me that to highlight how different I am now. In high school, I was the kid who got along with everyone but never felt connected to anybody at all. I was in the best friends group that constantly put each other down, because that's what bros do, right? But I always hated it. After high school I started at my local community college, but I hated it. And now it upsets me to no end how much people give me a hard time about not wanting to go to school. I started working at a McDonalds when I was 16, and it's the one thing I feel I'm really good at. I'm a crew trainer, and I've been told I'm next in line for manager. But that just isn't good enough for people! They tell me to apply myself more and be better than that. And I work so God damned hard at it, harder than anyone else there! But the worst part is this girl that works there. We started at the same time, and I've liked her from the very beginning. So a couple months ago when we started hanging out more I was so happy. I thought that this girl that I liked that worked there too wouldn't judge me for my dead-end life. And things were so great! We were seeing each other everyday, and things were so flirty, and I thought I had read all the right signs. So tonight I finally built up the nerve to tell her I like her and asked her out. And she was in total shock. And she said she didn't know what to say, but she's going through something right now. And I'm completely devastated! I really want nothing more than to down some pills and not wake up tomorrow for work. :'(
