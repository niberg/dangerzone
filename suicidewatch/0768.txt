No one's going to notice if I'm gone.

I've always been ignored by my family, friends, teachers, and just people in general. I don't get invited to things and it feels like my friends never include me. I've stayed in my dorm room for a whole week once without leaving and I didn't even receive a single text message.

Before I was going to wait to kill myself until I turned 23, but it's getting harder and harder to wait. I see literally no reason to live. I wish I had the courage to just do it now. 

Things would be so much better if I did it. For me, at least. No one else would even notice.
