I've pretty much figured out my plan.

i have a way to make it look like I just died, I think. 

I have a plan with a really high success rate that's peaceful and quick.

I'm tired. I don't know how soon I'll go. Whenever I get the last few bugs worked out and can get the supplies and work up the nerve. Maybe a few days, maybe a couple months. 

I don't know. Posting here isn't going to help, but it's nice to know there's a reccord of it somewhere. 

I'll probably post when i attempt to confirm, however long away that is,  that I'm not just seeking attention.
