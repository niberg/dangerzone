I want to end it all but at the same time, I don't.

I just feel like dying now. However, I really don't want to because I can't imagine how much emotional pain I would cause to my love ones. I'm trying to avoid telling my parents about this to avoid seeing them freak out. 
I'm horrible at school. I can't seem to understand anything the teachers say. No matter how many questions I ask, I end up looking like a dumbass and can sometimes frustrate the teacher. To make things worse, I procrastinate so bad. I just get lazy on doing the work and then I never turn in the work. I hate being like that and it's hard to change that about myself. It's come a point where Im going to give up on college because it's not the place for me.
Not going to college makes me relize I'm going to have a shitty future. I got nothing to look forward to in the future. I see nothing.
Family issues occur out of nowhere sometimes. When they happen, they're usually pretty bad. 
Im losing my best friend and it's one of the things that hurts me the most. 
In comparison with others, I guess I don't have it as bad but I just feel like killing myself. I got nothing to look forward to. I don't want to kill myself, but I feel like it's bound to happen when it's getting worse.
