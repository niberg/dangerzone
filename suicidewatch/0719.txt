I want to commit suicide really badly

I'm a total outcast and loser. Nobody actually enjoys spending time with me. I have no friends because I am dull. I have no social skills to speak of. I have nothing interesting to say. I have an amazing job but only have it because I work for my dad. I'm not even good at the job and anyone that speaks to me realizes that I shouldn't have it. I am 25 and just had my first girlfriend that broke up with me a month ago. It lasted 2 months but we only had about a 2 weeks that she was actually into it. Then she made up an excuse not to sleep with me or be near me. She pretty much told me that my lack of any social skills was what made her realize that she should have never considered going out with me. The pain of knowing you'll never be good enough for others or yourself is eating me alive. I just want to jump off a bridge to end this long journey of pain called life.
