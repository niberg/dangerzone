Ending it later this week.

I guess I just wanted to admit this to someone, even if it's just random people on the internet. So I've been suicidal for about four years now (I recently turned 21) and I picked a date a few months ago to do the deed. That date was November 12th, and since I haven't changed my mind, it looks like it's time. I'm booking a hotel room near my college for that day and I plan to spend the afternoon drinking and occasionally taking pills. Once I feel numb and relaxed enough, I'll slit both wrists in the bathtub and bleed out.

I'm completely unable to find happiness in anything in life. I'm actually quite privileged with loving parents and plenty of friends, but I live every waking moment in misery. I've recently stopped going to class and have basically just been kicking around and waiting for the 12th. I'm very comfortable with the idea of death, so I don't feel I'm entering anything scary. I'd prefer the absence of both pleasure and pain than the ever-hanging sense of pain and depression that defines my existence. And who knows, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised with what awaits me after the end (mainly joking here, I anticipate nothingness). 

So, that's it. Thank you to everyone that reads this, and I hope the rest of you find a reason to keep pressing on.
