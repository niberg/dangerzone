I'm done.

Either tonight or tomorrow, I'm taking all the pills I have. I don't have anything left to and I'm sick of being the closet about everything. I won't take my parents' hurt any more, but I can't leave either. This is the last way I can own myself and my decisions. I just don't want to hurt any more.
