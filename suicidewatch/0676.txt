Dear Reddit: Everyday sucks without him...

Let me give you some context of my relationship situation:

We met at a college summer research program and I originally hated him. He was arrogant, somewhat apathetic, dorky, and didn't understand social cues well. However, he was somewhat cute at times (his redeeming quality) and has a sincere heart. I had no intention of dating him in the beginning of the summer program and didn't have feelings for him at the time. Whenever he said an arrogant comment, I smashed him down and the other members of the program noticed how much we hated each other. 

As time progressed in the summer, we bonded over our mutual disdain of each other and became friends. We deeply bonded over nerdy hobbies, personality, art, and goals. His personality thrilled me and mine to him. He was hesitant to make a move because I am severely out of his league in terms of attractiveness and (this is an important part of this situation) but after a few drinks, he confessed his liking of me and I reciprocated his affection.

The last few weeks of the program were magical and we were falling in love. He was constantly attentive to me and followed me around. For the program, we went on outings and he would take me on dates and we would take about a potential future together (lightly but entertaining the idea). One night, I ended up taking his virginity and this escalated his affection for me. We both confessed that we had never met anyone like us and there was a mutual understanding of care and love. I believe (rationally) that he loves me still but is not emotionally ready for such commitment at our age.

Leaving the program, we realized that this was going to be a LDR because we live several states away from each other. The first few weeks were great and when I visited first (the first mistake I believe, men should initiate first), we were magical together. I have never felt this way (even in 2 year relationships) and all I wanted was to be near him. He grew distant one week prior to the break up and I became more codependent. When he broke up with me, I was already receiving counseling for some personal issues and I escalated out of control. I was confused why he broke up with me because I (realistically speaking) am well liked, smart and enrolled in a prestigious university, extremely fit, beautiful, and have a lot going for me in my future aspirations. On the scale, I was a far better catch than he was and yet since I couldn't blame him, I blamed myself and self-loathed. 

When he broke up with me, he said terrible things about me and made me feel like I was used sexually, that I was a trophy girl and not a real person, and that he never thought of us having a future. Even now (I am a month and a half out from this), it still burns me to my core. I have never been broken up with, especially with someone significantly less attractive than me (sorry I am probably coming off as vain). Long story short, I ended up in a psychiatric facility for treatment for a week because I couldn't function anymore. He eventually called to tell me he did care about me and that he said terrible things to make the break up happen because he couldn't handle being far away from me. We talked and agreed to not date (more on his side than mine).

Angrily a week later, I felt like I had no choice in this decision. I told him about my trip to the hospital in vivid detail and told him about my past trauma and how he exacerbated it. He emailed me back saying how guilty he felt about mistreating me and still said that he couldn't date me from afar because he couldn't afford it. His family makes significantly more money than my family and refuses to pay for transportation for him and I often wonder if it is because of my race. Since that last response, it has been 26 days of no contact and I am still struggling to push through each day. With continued treatment and support, I am surviving and improving but I still want him back and I still have suicidal ideation. We are still friends on Facebook and so he can see all my new photos having fun but he still hasn't reached out to me saying he misses me or anything...

Additional these are some barriers that we have to overcome in this relationship:
-money (we are both college students but his parents are not supportive of this relationship even though they make 3x as much as my family)
-race (we are different races and that might be adding some resistance from his family)
-maturity and age (we are both still in college and he has limited dating experience and has difficulty receiving and giving love)
-intimacy (since this is his first intimate relationship, he said that it clouded his judgement with persuing a LDR
-mental health (now that I am receiving treatment for Bipolar disorder (something triggered by him), he may be wary to reach out to me because he is worried I might snap and cause harm to myself)

Any thoughts on this situation? I feel very alone...
