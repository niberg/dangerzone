Was killing myself but nothing happened.

I hooked up a hose from the exhaust pipe to the window of my 01 Frontier crew cab, and I just blasted some tunes and stayed in the car for 30 minutes and nothing happened. The initial turn on of the ignition while I was inside got me dizzy for a minute or two, but after that, nothing happened. I was feeling at peace with finally not being able to feel pain, but mission failed. So tomorrow I'm going to Cabelas to buy a handgun and hope I actually accomplish my life goal. This fail isn't going to hold me back from my dreams of peace.
