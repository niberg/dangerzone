There's Just Nothing For Me Here

I'm just kind of a failure as a human being generally. It's really hard to quantify or express how blatant it really is. I'm fairly certain I have some form of undiagnosed Autism or even Schizoid Personality Disorder, or some other type of mental illness, because I just don't understand people or what they're about. I try, but it's like my motor is missing a part everyone else has. I even see and understand why too, but can't seem to replicate it in the slightest myself. That is the worst part of it all actually. I am too cowardly to try to get help.

I'm nearly 30 and have only had sex twice, both times horrible and pretty pathetic because I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do or how to interact with people in that way. I have never experienced romantic/true love and have serious doubts I ever will. My brain just doesn't do it, and humanity doesn't make copies of me as far as I can tell (thank god they are spared that).

My analytical nature drives people away and my lack of command or charisma does nothing to draw any in.

I used to drink a lot (and sometimes occasionally still do) to try to numb myself to how fucked up I actually am and try to forget it. It started jacking up my life so I quit. I can't depend on it to make me feel better anymore (it did help slightly).

I am actually quite exceptional at a few things, and used to take great solace in that, but it's just not enough anymore. The lack of humanity within has finally caught up with me.

I just want it to be over. I wish I had never been here.
