I need help

I have been depressed for quite some time with the hopes that I would start to get better if I waited it out. This started 3 years ago and I still haven't been able to get back to normal.
I recently went to see a counselor/therapist with the hopes that I would be able to talk about my depression and thoughts of suicide. The beginning of the initial session was going great until, for some reason, I started to lie. She, the counselor, asked if I ever had thoughts of suicide and I lied through my teeth to this total stranger. I also took a brief survey before the session that asked basic questions about my feelings and I lied about most of the depression/suicide questions.
I have no idea why I would lie and say I have never thought about killing myself. I really want to go back to the counselor, but I know i won't get the proper help if I lie about such important questions. 
I haven't been able to sleep or concentrate on anything other than drugs for the last couple of months. I have tried taking large doses of drugs like acid and 25i with the hope that I would spark some type of chemical happiness but this has just been a waste of money. 
I plan on killing myself next weekend when I visit my family and brother next weekend. I have taken the time and learned how to tie a noose. I am going to hang my self from an exposed I-beam in my basement. I might leave a note or something of that sort but I plan on just seeing all my old buddies that are still in town to say bye. 
sorry for the wall of text. It's unlike me to unload like this as I am quiet 
almost 24/7, but I feel like I should have done this a long time ago and  maybe my life would be different right now. Thanks for reading this if you got this far.
