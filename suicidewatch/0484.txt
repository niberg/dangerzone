It doesn't get better, it gets worse.

I'm a nobody and I always will be because I always have been.  
  
I'm too distant from anyone who has ever cared now. They don't want to talk to me. I'm too empty and I couldn't discourage them. Why should I bring them down? I've pushed them away. Things are only as they should be when I'm alone, but I don't think I can do this anymore. I spoke to somebody a few months ago about it. All anyone can say is that it gets better, but it doesn't. You lied to me. It only got worse. This world is too different and the only place I have in it is disposable. I've talked to somebody, I've given plenty of time, what do I do now?
