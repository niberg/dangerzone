Day #504

I'm using this as a place to rant, I suppose. Vent, maybe. I'm not sure. I don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone else about this. 

Anyways, I'm tired. I'm tired of a whole lot of things. I'm really quite tired of being tired, of being alone, of living for the sole purpose of doing what is expected of me. I'm tired of always being the best at what I do and getting absolutely nothing from it emotionally. I'm tired of endless projects and anxiety. I'm really tired of trudging through five hundred or so days with depression, maybe four hundred with suicidal ideation.

I'm not sure why I haven't killed myself yet. It would be a lot easier than the same old day-in, day-out emptiness. I have friends, I have success, I have family, and it means nothing. I've done things with my life, and it means nothing. I can't foresee any kind of respite in the future. It's just constant pressure, and anxiety, and expectations that are nonsensical to ask of any person, much less a broken one. 

Maybe it's the loneliness. I feel alone so much. Even around my friends, I still feel it. There's never anyone who I connect with on a truly deeper emotional level, and I'm never satisfied. I hate that, I hate myself for it. I don't know. I wish I weren't alone. And I know people will be all "you're not alone!" Eh. No one else is listening, and most of you are hundreds of miles away, which feels pretty alone to me. 

I just wish that I could jump on a train or something and abandon all of my commitments and everything, and just go be someone else. I fucking hate being me. I wish I could be the kind of person who just gets roaring drunk and stoned and high to ignore everything else, but I'm not. I wish I could just not be me. Given that that isn't an option, the only other way to achieve that is by offing myself. I don't know why I bother to keep going. I keep doing it, it keeps meaning nothing. Maybe I'll just go through with it at some point. I don't know.
