I have no value.

I made a post here a week or two back saying that I was scared,  I had suicide on my mind all the time. I had recently broken up with my Gf,  she meant a lot to me. I was a dick and just made her feel bad for a choice she was well within her rights to make.  I apologized to her and we seemed to be alright,  It was better for a bit,  then I found out she was seeing other people,  it was hard to deal with and I thought about suicide a lot again,  mainly dealing with throwing myself in traffic or in front of a train,  I confided this to her,  sans the jealously bit.  She showed a lot of sympathy and said she would always be there for me.  Now when I say that I have some stuff to say to help us be around each other and that it is important to me she says she is "probably busy" I know from Facebook that means she is just going out and hanging with our old friends with this new guy.  I feel replaced and worthless.  I have found myself obsessing about her responding to my messages and I hate that.  I don't want to be that kind of person.
