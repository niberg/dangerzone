I just want everything to stop.

Using a throwaway here as I know people who use reddit and know my real username. These past few days, my whole life got ruined, I was literally deserted by my family, my parents told me I'm dead to them.

The reason for all of this to happen? I fell in love with my cousin.

This love for my cousin had been going on ever since December last year, despite it being an on and off thing at start, we both started feeling love for each other. (We're 19 and 17) However, recently suspicions started to arise, and my little sister (who is 12) started trying to find out if something was going on between us.

Well guess what? She did, and she sent evidence to my parents who were away for holidays. 2 days ago at 3 am, I got a phone call. I normally am not up until that hour, but tonight I just decided to stay on the computer for a while longer. It was my mom, she was crying and told me I was dead to her. A lot of name calling proceeded on her part and told me she wanted to never see me again. Only place I had to go was my university room, which is where I am right now.

My cousin lived with us so after talking to me my mom told me to pass the phone to her. She kept calling her a whore, insulted her everytime she could and said that from now on she would only be called "whore". I didn't sleep that whole night, I took a train at 6 am for my university room and both my sister and cousin are in my parents' house waiting for them to return. I'm scared for my cousin, if she runs away she has nowhere to go to. I feel like my life has no meaning anymore, even if I make it through living alone, I will never see her again, I love her. I just want to end it all, and the only reason I didn't yesterday was because I got a phone call from my sister saying she was sorry and this was all her fault. I don't want to leave the burden of my death on my sister. But at this point it seems like the only thing that will make me stop crying the whole day.
