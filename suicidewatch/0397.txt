Help?

Extreme social anxiety/depression.. I have people tell me I'm lazy and thats why I can't get a job.. That's not the case. And it really bothers me inside when people say that. I act happy and friendly with friends and family when I am around them but it's all fake.. My stress is through the roof. When I'm alone I sometimes find myself curled up on the bed with my hands on my head humming to myself to try and relive the stress. It's hurting me. I can't hold a job and I don't want to be a burden to people like my friends and family because of my problems. I just want to be alone. A recluse. Please help me. I have very real thoughts about just ending it all. I'm just 24.
