Running out of options (long)

For quite some time I've been trying to find my place in this world. While the few friends I have left have started to get their life properly going. I'm talking girlfriend, engaged, stable job and all that stuff. A regular life.

I've tried it, I don't see the appeal in ever having a girlfriend, yet I'm lonely. I'm also a 22 year old virgin, to me it's quite sad, but I don't let that bother me too much. I don't see myself working a 'normal' job at all. This I've been struggling with since I got my first job in a merch-store. Been through a couple of jobs, IT-support, salesman, restaurant, most recently a food-store, working the floor/register.


I can't see myself doing this for long at all. I don't want a 'normal' life. I just can't stand it, I've been depressed, not a lot for quite some time, lost my father last year, and since then I've literally stopped living. Because for the past year, I've lived off of the money I got from his passing, it's running out soon and I don't want to live, it's getting worse and worse. And today was the first day I actually contemplated on suicide. 

Suicide does not make sense to me, I'm highly logical, but a part of me wants to do it. Just end it. It's been getting worse lately. 

The most frustrating thing is I know a way out, I mean, out of this thing. Getting a normal job and suffering through. But I don't want that, I SO don't want that, thinking about me literally puts me on the edge.

Right now, I'm so lost, I'm not sure what to do. I do know one thing, that I've never lost. What I'd want to be, I've always wanted to be an actor, but I can never see myself doing it, mostly because there is nothing nearby that even puts you in that direction, no school courses or anything. 

I'm not even sure if this post makes any sense anymore, I just want to get it all there. Because I'm truly lost now, I'm shit out of luck, no idea what to do. I don't want to do anything about it either.
