I just want to give up.

I'm not actually going to do anything. But I have never truly wanted to die this badly ever. I am so sick and I'm sick of fighting. I have no friends or family and I am all alone in this world. I'm fighting a chronic physical illness that has ruined my life and isolated me from almost everyone I love. I truly don't want to keep fighting and trying to get better. I just want to die. I don't know what to do. I just want to die. But I don't have the balls to actually go through with it. I have no idea what I would say to someone in my shoes so I don't know what I'm expecting to hear here, but I just needed to type it all out. Except I don't feel like I've typed anything out. I haven't even scratched the surface. This pain I'm feeling is so horrible. I know I didn't deserve the life I've been dealt but I refuse to keep living in this physical and emotional agony. It's not fair to me or anyone around me. Fuck. I don't know. I'm just sick of it all. I don't think I'll ever get better.
