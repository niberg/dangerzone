I'm so tired.

Of trying to make it through the day. 
Im nothing, I never have been.
I just want all the lain and suffering in my head to stop but it never does. 
Sure, I get distracted at times but my mind always goes back to my dark thoughts. 

I think about how easy it would be and it scares me.
