I've decided the best thing to do for everyone in my life is to end said life.

I'm done. I'm just ready to be done. Everything has gone south. Girl of my dreams dumped me over not texting her on Valentine's Day (this was February 2014). I annoy everyone. I'm facing a misdemeanor charge. I can't live with this shit. All I ever do is sob my eyes out all night and sleep all day. I'm thinking of throwing myself in front of the freight train that runs by my house at 3 am.
