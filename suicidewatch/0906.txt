Mom &amp; Dad (and everyone else, I guess.)


I'm sorry to cause you such pain. 

That's the hardest thing about this.

However, I can no longer see an intellectually compatible/socially acceptable way out.


So I'm going unacceptably.


I realize the selfishness of it, and if I didn't realize the grief and pain I'm bound to cause I'd have done this sooner.

This is nobody's fault. Mom and Dad, I thank and love you for the gift of life.

It was the ultimate experience and I will never take it for granted. 

My actions are the result of the consequences of our society's affinity toward malevolent motivations, expectations, and order.

These are strange days, and according to scribbles in a notebook, I ain't right. 


Don't bother bothering me.  

I coulda told you that.



I'd like to think of my passing as humble, comprehensible, sensible, and anything but tragic.  

It is a choice that I have made, and I am not despondent about it.

I hope a good majority of you can acknowledge that.

I am too conscious and too aware to fool myself into thinking that there is an ultimate and spiritual journey that I missed the train to.

I'd even go as far as to say that life is meaningless...but I don't believe that.  I believe life is ultimately dependent on itself.

The stress, the struggle, the pressure, the expectations, and the sheer naivety and ignorance proposed by my supposed confidants.

It's underwhelming and fails to motivate or appeal to me in any way shape, or form that it should.   

I should be excited...about something, at least...but I'm not.

I'm just not. Please don't be upset that I'm gone.  It's what I wanted, and I'm at peace.  This is the proof, despite the circumstances.

I think the cons have now exceedingly outweighed the pros.

And I just honestly do not wish to participate in this game any longer.

I fold.
