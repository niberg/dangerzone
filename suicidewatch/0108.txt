Foreign student about to flunk out and in a mountain of debt. Parents don't know and thinking about killing myself.

I am about to fail out of college and have a 130k debt undersigned by my parent's siblings who have green cards. If I flunk out, I would have to return to my third-world country without my degree. My parents would probably disown me and they would become pariahs with their relatives and in their community. They knew I had been doing poorly in my degree but thought it was better now.

I would have no job prospects if I return to that country without a degree which would allow me to pay off that debt. My relatives probably cannot pay off the debt unless I manage to get a job based on a degree I cannot get. They and I would probably have to declare bankruptcy. I have destroyed many people's livelihoods and dreams because of my colossal failure to work hard. It doesn't matter that I hate my field of study, the reason for this situation is me and my laziness.

I tried to think of jobs which wouldn't require a degree that could accept someone from a third-world country (India) and can pay off my debt but I cannot. I am considering killing myself in an accident so my parents can use my life-insurance policy. Maybe there are other options but I cannot see them at this moment. I have been emailing my adviser since they told me over email 2 hours ago that I will probably flunk out and they have not replied. If I cannot keep myself in college tomorrow. I will probably do something over the weekend.
