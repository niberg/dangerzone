I know i'm one of many.

Hi. I'm probably less likely than others to actuall do it. To the corageous people who surf this subbreddit looking to help people i applaud you. There are much more people who submit to this subbreddit than those who respond.

My story is i have aspergers. My life story is i can't do anything right no matter how hard i try. I have no one in my life right now to give me support other than a distant mother. I'm 24 male.

I'm sick of never being able to do the right thing while always trying to. No matter what i do and how hard i try i fuck up. I think i know what's right but it never is. I've learned that humans can't be honest to each other and it disgusts me. I despise lying to people regardless of the cost and i feel like its only to my demise. If anyone has anything to say thank you. If not don't worry about it.
