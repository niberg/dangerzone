I don't think I want to die but I'd rather die than keep living here

My family are fundamentalist homeschoolers. Aside from the internet, I have no contact with the Outside World. I have no friends because I'm not supposed to leave my house except for church stuff and live in a pretty isolated place, and all my family are also fundamentalists. 

My mom spends all her time screaming at everyone and sobbing and throwing things (I think she might be abusing prescription drugs), my extended family are mostly on drugs, my older siblings are on meth and/or in jail. 

My family are the not-fun kind of weird, Charismatic, Quiverfull Christians where we hate everyone. You know those denim jumper homeschoolers who believe god invented guns on the third day so we could fight the dinosaurs and the homosexuals? Literally us. And my parents think I'm Satan. Like, the literal actual human incarnation of the Father of Lies himself.

Also we're hoarders, and our house keeps getting infested with bugs. So that's nice. 

I've tried to just wait it out, listening to music, secretly reading non-Christian stuff on the internet, reading books, trying to learn multiplication on Khan Academy (my parents never taught us anything when they started homeschooling, so any grammar or spelling or math I know is stuff I've figured out on my own)

But I can't do it any more. I have no future outside this cult. I have no education and no money and no way out. And even though I have one or two online friends who say I'm not bad, I still see myself as so evil and so worthy of Hell. I was exorcised a ton of times and had all my stuff burned and had oil poured over me, but none of it ever fixed me.

So...I guess this is goodbye, I don't know. I want to get out but I just...I don't know how. I don't know how I'll ever get a job or even interact with the outside world. I just...I don't know.
