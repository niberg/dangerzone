Goodbye everyone. Good luck, and thanks for everything. I'm sorry.

This will probably be my last post. I posted on /r/depression yesterday, but felt like I should post here too. 

I just can't do this anymore. I'm going to give myself maybe a week or two, just in case some miracle occurs, but I know that's not going to happen. I probably won't be around at the end of the month. Thank you all for helping me through some tough stuff. You really are all amazing people. I wish you all the best, and I hope you all get through what I can't.

I'm sorry.
