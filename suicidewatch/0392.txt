Why should I go on?

I've been abused for a majority of my childhood, emotionally, mentally, and physically. As I grew older I learned to deal with why the things that happened had happened. I learned to forgive my mother and move past the past, but it has left me lost and with what seems like no hope. It has turned me into a person I truly hate, but see no way of changing it. I have friends and family, but nobody I feel I could confide in. I'm surrounded by people that care about me, yet I feel alone. When anyone I currently know tries to talk to me I shut down and push them away. I want to meet new people but can't force myself to in fear of getting close to them and getting hurt, or hurting them. That's a big thing, after everything that my mother has done to me, I avoid any relationship with a person because I have a fear that I will hurt them (Not necessarily physically but emotionally). So I isolate myself in hopes that I may slip by. I feel like I have no ambition to do anything, no will to push me forward. Quite often when I take a shower I think to myself and wonder why I even go on. There has been only one thing in my life that I was ever certain about, ending my life.
