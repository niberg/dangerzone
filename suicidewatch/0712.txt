Hey

Can I just like talk to someone? getting some negative thoughts about my position in college. In debt, dismissed from my engineering school I actually wanted to be in(because I wasn't smart enough) I actually loved the subject matter of computers, and it pains me to be doing something I don't even like, mathematics(funny, it's the closest thing I could transfer over too, but then I might have too many hours to do that even). Recently went to registration offices of said school because I'm still undeclared, saw an old classmate who is a junior now, same as me, was total foreigner entering college, but now is working the student services desk and is still an engineer. Do you know what it's like to see other people surpass you academically, socially, domestically, physically? I feel like genetics is such a bitch. And I don't want to graduate only to be a corporate wageslave, I want to work for myself. But things are really hard right now. The winter seems so soothing, and I feel like ending it soon.
