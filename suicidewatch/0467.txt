I usually don't whine.

I'm never happy. I literally hate my life and pretty much everyone (even family) in it. I'm a young, pretty attractive male, but I just can't enjoy anything. And the littlest things set me off and ruin my day, all the time. I see an old lady and immediately hate her. Maybe it was all the drugs and alcohol I did in the past recently, but I've always been pessimistic. I just...very deeply hate my life.
