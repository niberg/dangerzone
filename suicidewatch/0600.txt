What's the point?

I am just an 18 year old who has hated herself for so long she can't remember how to love. I can't connect, I can't relate, I can't cope. I'm just so tired, you know?  Tired of being so distant from life. Tired from not fitting in. Tired of feeling absolutely worthless and awful 24/7. I'm just tired of being tired..
And I have hopes. I have dreams. I want things out of life, just like everyone else. I want to move on with my life. I don't want to be stuck in this hell I've been living in for God knows how long. I want to be an actor. I want to move to New York from this stupid little New Mexican town I'm in, and I want to live. Actually live. Not just be alive. 
That's how I feel. I feel like a lifeless living being with no purpose. I'm breathing, my hearts beating but there's nothing there.
