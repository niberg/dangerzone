I found a way, but why am I not doing it? (explanation in post)

My dad is a terminally ill man. He suffers from heart failure, kidney failure, COPD, lung failure, and this very complicated form of cancer. In our fridge we have boxes covered in bright orange tape, they say danger or something I don't remember. I got the courage to ask my mom what they are. Apparently the doctors refer to them as pain relief kits. They have morphine in them. I'm talking 30 vials of liquid morphine. My dad is prescribed heart medication, high blood pressure meds, inhalers, and a few other meds I'm not sure of (I don't know the scientific names because there are 30+ meds, maybe I can ask for more detail?) I know he is prescribed Valium, Xanax, liquid morphine (hyrdromorphine?) and an anti depressant. I want to know what's stopping me. It's eating me alive that I haven't done it, but something is stopping me. I also have a crucial question. my dad is very abusive sometimes and he makes me feel like shit, but he is my dad, and he deserves good days too. If I were to take the medication he is prescribed, is he allowed to get a necessary refill if they prove it was me who ingested them? I want to die, but my dad deserves his (supposedly final year) to be a good one.
