How old were you?

I came across another, older, post in another subreddit about suicide. One of the comments talked about trying to kill him/herself at the age of 8. Most of the replies were shocked at the age. Made me realize the first time I seriously thought about killing myself was when I was about 8 or 9. Of course the ideas I had weren't even close to fatal, but no wonder I've had so many problems over the years.

After than, the next time things got really serious was when I attempted at 16. The past few months, now that I'm in my late 20s, have been probably the third time things are really bad.
