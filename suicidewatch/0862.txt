I just wanted someone who keeps talking to me and doesn't stop after a few conversations

I have one friend who I barely see and no one one who goes to my school even talks to me. I am borderline suicidal. Really the only thing keeping me alive are my parents and dog. Other than that I have nothing to live for. Just one year ago I had an amazing girlfriend and the best group of friends I could ask for. All of this started to go down hill when my girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. The relationship was long distance and some things on her end prevented her from being able to commit fully. and it was me being too clingy. This was my freshman year and then my friends started changing. They started drinking and losing all sense of right and wrong. They'd make Facebook pages for special needs kids making fun of them. They'd make jokes about suicide and the general vibe of the group was mean and rude. We got into a fight over something I don't even remember and now they don't talk to me. Writing this has made me just want to kill myself even more. I don't even have online friends.
