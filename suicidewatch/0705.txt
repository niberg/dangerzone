If not suicide then what?

I don't do anything all day, I can't talk to women (even those cam girls online, who are just pretending to like everyone). I get anxious just leaving my apartment and taking public transport. Everyday is a struggle, 12 hours go by, and it's time to sleep again, having done nothing. There's no job, no friends, nothing. Somehow I had a girlfriend three years ago, but I was still a clueless idiot, she did all the approaching. People my age are fucking getting married (24). It's not cute to be an awkward shy guy at my age, but it doesn't matter because I shouldn't complain because I'm a white man. 

If my some chance there is motivation to make money, move out, meet people, all those years of isolating don't just disappear. Some would say I deserve it for being so bitter sometimes. I don't know anymore, being alive is a waste in my case. 

Please don't offer me empty "it will get better" wisdom. Sorry, but what guarantee do you have? None.

The irony is my social anxiety also prevents me from buying a gun and shooting myself, so there's that.
