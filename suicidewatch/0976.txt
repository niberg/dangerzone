I wonder if I can watch them all regret....

I've asked for help. I've reached out for help. And time and time again, the responses I get either say that (a). I overreact too much. They say that my problems don't matter. (b) They ignore it. They just say what they want and not listen to what I have to say. I am someone who suffers from depression and an extreme inferiority complex.My life revolves around other people. It has been like this as long as I remember. Right now..... I feel like I don't matter at all. I feel like everything I I did to please them.... Everything I did to make myself a better person.. don't matter at all. And since I don't matter.. I guess they won't care if I went out of their lives.... but.. the only way stopping me from taking my own life is my cowardice. I hate myself.......
