seven days ago i almost committed suicide...

I have a prescription for zoloft and trazadone and a bunch of cough medicine pills saved up... i also have a whole bottle of vodka to go with it. i know thats probably not enough to kill me but it might at least make me pass out... and i have a whole bottle of advil too. last time i tried i only took six prozac's and ended up in the hospital for six days. i would do it right this time.
