I need to be admitted

For myself. I'm scared i'll hurt myself. I'm suicidal, i'm self harming and I know it will just get worse. Every night I find myself drinking and becoming drunk. I'm 22, I've been in therapy since I was 16. This past June, I hit a rough patch in my life and I ended up in the ER and I told them I wanted to die, that I felt suicidal. They sent someone to evaluate me and apparently i'm fine and they told me I needed to see a psychiatrist (which I've seen 3 already) and I literally just seen him for the first time two weeks ago. That's how long it took for them to help me. I don't feel safe..i'm drunk, i've been cutting myself and I don't kno wwhat to do.
