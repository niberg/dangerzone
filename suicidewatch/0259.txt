Need help talking to a friend

OK some background first. I was a college resident assistant for three years and have had QPR training and had experience with talking college freshmen out of ideas of self harm and potential suicide (about 4-5 cases).

But now that it's one of my friends it's become a lot scarier. From what I have got so far he has been having suicidal thoughts for about two weeks but isn't severe enough to where he knows how he would do it. He lives about two hours from me so I can't exactly check up on him often. I need some advice reddit, what do I do?
