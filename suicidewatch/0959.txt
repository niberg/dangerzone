I ruined everything that I built and now I'm just ready for it all to go away.

I feel like an absolute failure. 

I'm a fairly attractive female (although I wouldn't agree that I'm anything better than a 3.) I have never had problems with rejection, I've always gotten everything I have ever wanted. I have never dealt with someone telling me that I am not good enough, sexy enough, or etc. (Except a female ex... but bitches are bitches.) 

Right now I'm in school. I have a phenomenal GPA, finished a semester off with a 3.8 and am just continuing to work towards my goals. 

But for fucking what?

I've realized I'm not the type to date, I hurt people, I destroy relationships. I have an eating disorder that ruins every type of friendship or relationship I build. So I've given up on finding someone to be happy with. 

What's my problem then? I just don't want to exist anymore. I don't want to have to worry about myself and my weight. I don't want to think about how I hurt everyone and ruin everything. 

I mean what's the point? I either end up unhappy and alone, or end up killing myself. 

There's really no in between. 

I'm just tired of it all.
