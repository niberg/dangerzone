Failing at Life

I have been lying in bed crying for the majority of the morning.


Today spring registration for graduate students is open. There are only 2 classes available that I have left to take-- they are only offered once a year-- and I can't take any of my other classes until I have taken those. One class only has 10 spots which is ridiculous and your name has to be on a waiting list in order to register for them. Over a month ago I emailed the office and was told I was put on the waiting list for these classes. At 8 o'clock this morning I got online and proceeded to register. It locked me out and told me I needed to contact the department chair.
So I emailed the secretary and SHE NEVER PUT ME ON THE LIST. After forwarding her the confirmation email SHE sent me an hour later she says I'm on this list. Thank God. Buuuuut I logged back on and received the same error message.
If I do not get in this class I have to wait a YEAR until I can take anymore classes AND that's ONLY if I get in them. there are no other classes I can take until then because they must be taken in sequence-- the best part-- I'll have to start paying back my $40,000 dollar loans immediately. The worst part- I just got laid off


How can everything be working against me right now.
