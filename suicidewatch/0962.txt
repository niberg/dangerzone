I imagined my whole life

Hello, I apologise posting here again so soon. Little while ago I posted about breaking up with my wife; I am sincerely thankful for all help that was offered to me then.

Today I am writing again because I feel utterly lost. I believe I have fully made this relationship up in my mind - it never existed in reality. I have schizophrenia, it has all been a delusion.

I aprubtly came to this conclusion after experiencing a breakdown of sorts earlier today.

Since then I have had horrible flashbacks of the people I imagined. I feel suicidal, I do not know what reason there is in my life anymore. On last weeks, I have suffered because of this delusion very much, but there still were times when I loved them... the only people who loved me.

I don't know what I have left to live for.
