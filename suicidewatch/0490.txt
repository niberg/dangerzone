Questions about my daily thought process... Weird shit

So for the past two years... It seems like every single day that does not go by that I literally am thinking of ending my life.  I'm to the point where I have pieced together how I am actually going to come to an end. That's how long it has been.  It seems as if the thought becomes much stronger when a failure,  downfall, or lost relationship happens. 

When thinking of actually partaking in the thought, it always seems to be a more peaceful than sad. Like a subtle release. 

I really don't know why the fuck I think like this. It's happened to me before the past two years but not as frequent as mentioned. Any suggestions on what I can do..?
