Maybe music can save me?

I used to really love music. My head isn't even clear enough anymore to remember what used to move me but I have this vague sense... I heard "The Jackson Song" by Patti Smith (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OVnNePQPsQ) and I started to feel something in my cold, dead heart. Something about that song reminded me of my mother and how I felt being her little boy. As I listen to it now tears come to my eyes. I haven't cried in a year. I haven't felt anything.

I want to believe in love again. Love for someone special that makes you stop and focus, work hard for years, dig deep to find courage, transform yourself, take this moment seriously, sacrifice yourself, feel so much enjoyment and enthusiasm that depression or anxiety is impossible, realize an important purpose, feel determination and motivation to deliver, feel a sacred duty.
 
I need to feel this way towards life.... That each moment is too important to waste on self pity. That there is something important and meaningful to do... To truly love.

Please if you could help by posting songs that remind you that there is real selfless love in this world and why we put up with all of the suffering. Please. Thank you.
