Broke up with boyfriend. Now all I think about is killing myself.

I've had a history of being suicidal. Attempted twice while I was in high school. I don't have a terrible life, I just don't want to be here. I thought I would be happier if I left my boyfriend, because the relationship was taking a lot out of me, but now I'm realizing he helped keep me grounded. Now that's he's not there (he's currently ignoring me/doesn't want anything to do with me), I feel like a balloon with its string cut, and the higher I go, the closer I am to popping. I haven't thought about suicide in a while, but I feel it so fucking strongly right now. It's like the old days where everywhere I look, I see something I could kill myself with. I want to die so badly. He made me feel like I had a purpose, now I feel like I have none. Help.
