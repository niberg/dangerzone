I dont understand my emotions?

For the past few years, ive never really felt truly happy. I have only one friend that I truly trust to be there for me, and that actually knows me. the rest of my friends dont actually know the type of guy I am, and dont understand me. I get sad very easily, but I enjoy it so much. I used to, and still, love the thought of suicide. I know that for the time being, I wont, because I love my family and I dont want to leave them. THe thing is, even though I wont be ending my life anytime soon, I love the thought of dying. Some times, I really just hate to live, no one understands me, I dont enjoy many people, my school performance is subpar, and I feel like my life is going to go nowhere. I do many things a typical guy would do. I do two sports, play guitar, love PC games, and the usual but sometimes I cant stand being alive. I find comfort in sadness. I can definitely be happy, if im not stressed and wit hgood friends, but most of the time, my mind is on overdrive, contemplating everything in my life, mostly the negatives. My emotions haunt me. I struggle with anger issues, im a very nice guy but no one understands me.I just cant seem to bear how people are nowadays, and I enjoy my mind running wild with imagination of death and my inevitable passing. Ive always felt this is just a mental issue of mine, but I dont really know. Can anyone help me?

edit: to add, I dearly love my family, and my sister. They seem like the only ones in the world that really keep me going. My days at school are unbearable, I cant concentrate and I feel very depressed, but i love being home ,with my family.
