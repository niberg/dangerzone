Why am I still here?

I have posted a few times, so apologies to anyone who has dealt with me before.

I am continually feeling stuck. Nothing about life excites me. Scratch that, I don't feel anything about my existence. I feels so pointless. I cannot distract myself any more - everything feels so difficult, and that feeling does not wane. I try reading, games, music, my guitars, learning a language, learning to code, drawing, writing, talking. I just can't break free.

I do take medication. I have tried many, at varying doses. I have been referred for counselling by my GP. I can't afford it otherwise. These efforts haven't progressed, I just get placed on a waiting list, and told to go various events I have no interest in. Why I explained I just  want to talk things through, I don't want these random classes/events, I get an "ok" and not much else. I check up on my status, my position and keep being told I have a 6 month wait.

I really just want to give up. People around me don't get, or don't want to get how I feel. The people I cared about as so disinterested in me it hurts, or I imagine I should do. I can't pour myself into anything or anyone else anymore.

This is pathetic, and I'm sorry.
