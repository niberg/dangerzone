How can I help a friend miles away?!?

I met an incredible friend over the summer on an amazing adventure however after it was all over she returned to her home in Massachusetts and I to Texas. 

We're both teenagers and she is extremely dear to me. She has suffered anxiety her whole life and endures frequent panic attacks. Although she has visit the hospital multiple times and takes medication I can see shes still suffering. She worries about what others think about her and what they say about/to her. 

Shes missed countless days of school and on two occasions tried to take her own life. I message her almost daily and during her panic attacks I try to calm her down. Shes told me she feels like I am the only one that understands her yet while we talk she sometimes tells me that i don't have to keep talking to her. She feels like by talking to me she is bothering me and taking time away from my life but I've told her countless times thats not the case and that I'll always be here for her. I try my best to help her and get her to take steady breaths but I don't know if its working. I need help helping her!! Shes called the suicide hotline but was too scared so she hung up and the police came to her house. I don't know her situation with her family but she lives with her two parents. However it seems that she isn't as close with them as she is with me since she tells me she feels alone. I don't know how else I can help her from sooo far away and I wish I could physically be there for her. Please help me!!
