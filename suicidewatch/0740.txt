Im going to kill myself this week

I have no money, no job, no girlfriend, i do have friends but they dont really care. I live with my parents who resent my existence and my relentless drug abuse. I'm so tired but i can't sleep. Im so lonely but i can't talk to people. Im so sad but i dont even know what makes me happy. I just need a few days to write a note, finish some things and find a suitable method. But I'm almost certain this is my last week on Earth. 

Im not terribly sad but i am disappointed; i actually like this world i would have liked to continue living but i simply can't. I feel like not everyone with mental illness is meant to survive. 

I think id like to do something interesting this week. It being my last. If anyone has suggestions or ideas if it was your last day on earth (and you had no money) to do whatever you wanted, it'd be greatly appreciated.
