My life is a fucking joke.

I'm bad at talking to people and making friends.  Recently I've really tried in making friends and managed to make a female friend and befriended her 2 male friends.  We hang out and she says her friend from home is coming out to visit and is always down to fuck.  Of course I get my hopes up at this, but then she says her friend is only into big dicks.  The shit I'm rocking is probably on the low end of average at best.  What the fuck.  I'm tall so I look disproportionate as fuck and I bet it looks hilarious from a girl's perspective.  

I suck at people, I have a small dick, I can't even drown my sorrow in booze.  Or go to a party and get buzzed and more talkative.  That social lubricant.  

I swear I must have autism or something as well as klinefelter's.  My life is a goddamn joke that must be hilarious if there is any higher being watching from the outside.  Probably not, but if there was.  

I have never had a girlfriend at 22 years old.  I guess my dick is small because now her two male friends won't stop giving me shit for it.  I'm suffering in school.  I make shit for money, my dad gets on my case about health care since I'll be off his plan in a bit.  

I'm just so tired.  Everything I try life fucks me over.  My best effort is never enough.  I don't think I'll ever get a girlfriend.  I don't ever think I'll be happy.  I'm just so tired, I want to sleep forever.
