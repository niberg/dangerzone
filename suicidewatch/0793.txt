I'm back (Not suicidal)

Hello everyone, I hope the break I took from this sub for a while helps me keep going on. I got several problems that needed attention asap, and now I think everything's ok.

About this sub, I would like to ask about new memebers around: where can I retake helping people? I usually start by posts without a comment, but now there are none of that kind, are they?
Secondly, how many new threads are made, let's say, in some hours? I would like to keep in sync both my usual agenda and spare time for this place, so, around what time is this place a bit more active?
/(^__^)/ I hope we get outta here alive!
