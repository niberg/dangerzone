One month later

It's been a month since the last time I even contemplated suicide. I tried hanging but there was nowhere on the ceiling to affix the damn belt to. After a few hours I reconsidered my priorities. Spent a while browsing here. Talked to the hotline. Long story short everything got straightened out and in two days I was a much happier person than I had been in the past three months. And I haven't even thought about seriously doing it since.

Looking back, I'm amazed what I've managed to achieve that I wouldn't have if I had offed myself thirty-one days ago. In the past month, I lost my virginity, composed almost an entire rock opera, watched the chaos of Halloween leave the frat houses and enter the streets (our hospital, one of the largest in the region, ran out of beds in their ER from all the drunk people they took in, they had to ship them five miles to the east), and watched fourteen hours of StarCraft the following day with people who I'd never met before and one week later I talk regularly to.

And a lot of it is thanks to all of you. Your unyielding support and willingness to help strangers over the Internet on your own time. Sometimes I just browse this subreddit to see the amazing motivation that you guys deliver. Thank you.
