I'm a broken human being that can't connect with people

I was talking with some friends (I guess you could call them that) and they were surprised to find out that I had never had sex before, never even kissed a girl or even held hands.  I literally don't know how to do any of that shit.  

They talked about dating about how it's the easiest thing in the world, where you just go up and talk to them and bam, next thing you know you're dating.  That hasn't worked for me.  I'm 22 years old and have never dated before in my entire life.  

They also went on to say that sex is amazing.  Well guess what, that shit is something that is so far unobtainable for me that I literally don't even try anymore.  Not to mention I have a fucking small dick.  

I can't make connections on that level with a girl, I don't think it'll ever happen.  I probably will never have sex.  To top it all off they're going on and on about how it's just so goddamn easy to date and fuck.  Like this life struggle that I'm facing is no big deal.  

God fucking damnit this shit pisses me off.
