What can we really do for ourselves?

After a particularly bad argument with my husband this afternoon I figured I'd pose this question to the SW community. I've been terribly suicidal for a while now and have tried to help myself get out of it. I've seen therapists, gone to two marriage counselors, started lifting, changed my diet, and have eliminated negative friendships/ habits. 

He is getting frustrated and saying that everything he reads online says that you cannot help someone who is suicidal without professional help or going to a psychiatric ward. Which I actually already have done as well when I had severe PPD last year. 

I would like to just give up and move ahead with my plans. I will share my personal reasons for wanting to do this if you guys want my story, but this is really more of a general "what can one do" kind of question.

TL;DR If you feel you have exhausted your self-help options, and you are seeing a counselor you trust, what can you do other than going to a hospital or trying new medication when you want nothing more than to end it?
