Life is just not worth it

I dont even know where to start or how the feeling got as strong as it is now. I know that it seems every way i go theres something bad just waiting for me. Ive lived my life with a mom has always said she didnt  love me because i looked like my dad. I was abused both physically and mentally by her. And the pain is still deep till this day, i think one of the things that hurts the most is that i just want her to love me, i would do anything for her to show that she cares, but thats a whole other story. 

My son passed away about 9 years ago now. They say all woumds heal in time but that just not true. I still till this day have nightmares of him taking his last breath in my arms. I held him as he died. It seems like with time the pain is getting worse my dreams are more vivid and real. 

Ive become a total loner, i cant even bring myself to get out of bed, and half the time i feel like why even try. I have a relationship that i dont want to be in but feel forced to be in because ive been the stay at home mom and he works so i have no income to leave. Ive also been abused in this relationship mentally. ANything that an be said to bring a person down has been said and done to me.  I just i dont feel like this life has anything to offer me. I dont even understand what i was born for. to just be in a life of pain, and hurt. If there is a god i hope I am forgiven. Im alone, and hurt, and cant take this any more. 
I feel like now is the perfect time no one is home,  im by myself and no one will care. Poeple die in this world and it just keeps going.  I think its time.
