What can I say?

Hi, r/suicidewatch. I need help.
I have a friend who, just today, told me they were going to write a suicide note, and that they were done with life.
I told him my situation (with my own depression, from my post in r/depression) and that I felt similar to how he does. He feels worthless, and that everyone believes he is.
I tried to tell him that I am there for him. That I care what happens to him. I also told him that the best revenge he can have is to live his life, and to be the winner (as in not letting everyone else win by taking his life).
He seems to be very defiant, though, and isn't listening to things I've been saying. I'm having trouble getting through to him on what happened and why he feels the need to do this.

I need some help with talking to him. Can anyone give me advice?
