... I don't know why.

I've been thinking of suicide. 

I've been depressed for a year now and taking anti depressants. But the thing is... My life is going so good. I'm a model and just now have been successful in doing it, I've just earned a state crown in a pageant, a loving fiance... Basically an okay life. Even though I have this right now I can't help being so... Depressed


I don't know why. 


Before I met my fianc√© I was an addict and he's led me to a better life. But I still feel like something is missing. I'm actually shaking right now typing this. 
He thinks that my depression is over. But it's here every night I sleep next to him. I cry until I fall asleep. I do a very good job hiding it every single day. 
I'm just now speaking up because it's getting so painful lately everything is just so bottled up inside you know?  Everyone knows me as a social butterfly and many admires me. But instead of being happy about it, it makes me more... Down... Depressed... Sad... Nothing.

 
I've been thinking about suicide lately... But with all the things I have so far in my life.... I don't want to hurt them. 


I don't know anymore. 


I'm tired of pretending. I feel like I'm being an attention whore right now. But I just need to let it out to something someone at least... 
I don't know what to do. And honestly I'm so tired of everything already. I know it's such a waste... But...  It's just been so hard and it gets harder... And harder....  I can't take it anymore. 

... Why can't I be happy with what I have right now? I'm just...  Not.
