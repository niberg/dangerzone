Feeling alone. Being alone. Just having a hard time.

These SW posts are so sad. Does anyone else feel like that's all they do here?  Watch Suicide happen?

I'm so sorry to all of you who post here and just need someone to hold on to you.  I would but I can't even hold onto myself.  I know where you are and I'm so terribly sorry

I'm not in danger of removing myself soon. My time frame is less then 2 months. I have time.
