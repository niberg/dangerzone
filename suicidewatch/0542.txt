I want to survive a suicide attempt. (x-post from /r/mylittlesupportgroup)

I'm standing on my balcony, weighing the pros and cons of living. I cheated at school today and I got a warning. I don't care anymore. I don't have the drive for anything.

My mother runs outside and looks at me, fury in her eyes. "Get the fuck down!"

"I'm not worth anything, anymore, mom, I'm going to lighten the weight off of everyone's shoulders today." I jump, and hear my mom screaming and crying in slow motion as I fall. I hit my face on hard stone, and black out.

I wake up in a hospital bed, barely able to move from pain. I open my eyes and see friends, people I never knew cared for me. I never recalled anyone caring for me, no matter how much they said so.

"Tal! You're okay!"

The hospital room explodes in applause as my best friend comes by and starts crying, says how scared he was to lose his only friend. One of my female friends starts bawling and comes over to hug me, telling me never to do that again.

Is it wrong for me to want this? This has been my fantasy for a while. I don't have the drive for anything, I'm cheating at school, I've barely done any of last year's schoolwork. I want all of this weight off, but no one believes I'm depressed. I'm almost fucking 16, and I want to die already.

Is it really wrong?
