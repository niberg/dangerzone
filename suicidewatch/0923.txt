My entire world has fallen apart. I've done everything and anything to help....nothing has.

Long story short, I'm 26. I've been in love of my best friend of 20 years for the passed 15. She keeps telling me words of hope for the future, but I always expect otherwise. I've been there for her in every situation whether it was a bad relationship or general depression. She means more to me than my family, friends, and self. (That's what best friends are supposed to be right?) She was hooking up with some guy for a while who stopped hanging out with her but as of tonight, they reconnected. She says they're just going to leave and do something innocent. But I know that's not the case. I'm not an idiot. I've contemplated leaving the state and even the country. But just knowing the thought that she's out there with someone that isn't me....just the thought that my entire life has been a lie....that she's been lying to me for so long...that my Turk, my Shawn, my Gus...at the same time, my Elliot, my Topenga, my Juliet, has been feeding me nothing me nothing but lies for all these years has ruined me.

I've lost weight, gained muscle, picked up new hobbies, made new friends, everything possible to imagine. But I can't help but feel I know what my fate will be. Consistently listening listening to Greensleeves, Your Know You're Right and Alone I Break doesn't help, but lyrically and musically they fit all too well.

I don't actually want help. I know what I'm going to do. I don't know when....stupid me thinks there's still hope. I know she's on reddit...she doesn't know my /u/. But I know hers....I guess I just wanted to try and get this shit off my chest before I do what I was always meant to.
