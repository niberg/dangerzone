Lost at the worst possible time

I'm stressed, confused, lonely and scared. Exams are coming up and my relationship of almost 10 months is in a very bad place. If it ends now then it's going to screw up my exams and ruin my future. Even if it doesn't end, the stress it's putting me under is making me constantly depressed and is just as bad. I've recently fallen out with a good friend and feel like I have nobody. I'm only able to see my best friend once or twice a month and I can't cope with being so alone and stressed at such a crucial point in my life. Help. Please.
