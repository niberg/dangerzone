I don't know how much longer I can take it

I feel like everything in my life is working against me. Every time I feel like I've done something right, I get knocked back ten steps. Everything is so shitty. My depression is getting worse and worse, and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like this. I'm scared of what I might do to myself one day. I already take too many sleeping pills at night and too many ativan during the day when I know I'm not supposed to, but a small part of me wants to believe that they make the pain go away. I'm scared that one day I'll take too many. How much more pain can I take before I decide to take that whole bottle? I don't want to face the rest of my life when I know I'll just be feeling like this.
