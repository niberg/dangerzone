Not Much Left to Do Now

I had a serious discussion with my dad about my depression, I find that I just can't make myself care about life anymore. He didn't seem very concerned. Mostly he seemed annoyed, and maybe disappointed.

I don't care though. I'm not hurt or mad at him. See, my dad and I were never close, even though he's my only remaining family around. I just thought I owed it to him to give him some kind of explanation for the things I might do. I hope the experience is at least a bit less of a shock when he gets a call from the police or however he finds out when I've gone.
