God, are you there?

God
Are you there?
I am still breathing
My heart is still beating..
But I feel so dead

People tell me all the time
That you are the savior
The comforter 
The way

But I can't understand
I can't believe 
When I feel so betrayed 

I don't feel safe or like I've been saved
I don't feel comfort and I'm actually more afraid
But most of all..
I am lost 
And I can't see the way 

God
Are you listening? 
For the love of all things
Please just tell me you hear me

I feel so ignored 
And alone
No one knows who I am 
They know my face and my name
But my story?
Hell 
I couldn't even begin to recite it

You are a liar 
A coward 
A cheat 

God
I have failed you
And you have failed me

God
Are you there?
Are you listening?
