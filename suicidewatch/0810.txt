Why can't I give up?!

I have been depressed since I was 13 years old, I'm 19 now. I have dealt with my depression pretty well until the last year. I was in an abusive relationship for 3 years with a woman who verbally and physically abused me. It ended a little over a year ago. After the relationship was over I had a lot of unresolved issues with myself and had a lot of self doubt. After about 6 months I decided that life was no longer living because I am such a failure. I live in my grandma's house and would be homeless if it wasn't for her. I am a joke who works for a piece of shit restaurant and is going nowhere in life. I was put on a 51/50 hold for trying trying to hang myself but my mom found me. I was put on medication that I took until I got pregnant. I stopped and the depression was under control I didn't want to die.... Until I had to have an abortion. I wouldn't bring a beautiful child into this world when I can't even take care of myself. I had it about a month ago and I feel like I should just die... I am nobody special, my mom hates me,  my dad doesn't talk to me, my boyfriend will forget about me and the child I killed and I have no friends because I'm a mean bitch and never went to school because I was too busy being with a 22 year old at 15.  My life is a joke and I just want to give up. That is my only wish... To let me give up and fucking die...
