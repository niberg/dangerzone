Finally Found a Way Out .. . Hoooray!!

32m
depressed for 10 years
suicidal for 5
Been on meds &amp; therapy for 2 months (welbutrin)
Going on 8 weeks of "intense outpatient" 3h/3d/8w
Hoping it doesn't turn into inpatient

Have just about everything you could ask for just can't handle the stress, pressure, and overall b.s. that is life. 

I wish i could say that the love i have for my family/fiance is enough, but it's not. . The love we have for each other has kept me alive for this long, but i finally found a way out for all of us. I swore i would never kill myself because of the pain it would cause, but ive been at the edge of my sanity for far too long, and my family seems to enjoy life so the best thing i can do for all involved is make it look like an accident.

They get to mourn without questioning themselves w/ the guilt of what,why, shoulda , woulda bullshit our minds love to do, i get to die, and they get to live their lives. The End.

Ill keep this thread open until that special day so all questions and comments are welcome until then . .. ...
