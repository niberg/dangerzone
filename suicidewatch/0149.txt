A warning (Not Suicidal)

I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here, but I feel the need to post this.

You may have seen a large amount of people saying "oh I've been through so and so and I'm from /r/ultrahardcore." I just want to say, about 95% of the people who say this, or who will say this are trolling. The community has publicized this aggressor as an almost easy way to get attention, or sympathy. There have been cases where people have come here for legitimate help, but as of now, a lot of people will be coming here seeking for attention.

If this is not allowed here, I will gladly remove it. Just be on the look out for bullshit posts.
