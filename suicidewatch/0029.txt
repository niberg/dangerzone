A reminder of my past life has really shaken me today, just need something to anchor me

My entire school life I was bullied, I was at a small rural school so there was no means of escape, the main perpetrators were a set of male twins and a girl, the boys then went to he same secondary school as me and continued the abuse, they were so popular that the whole school turned on me   (they are now successful actors , so very charismatic if they like you) to the extent that when I was 13 I attempted suicide and was removed from the school.
i'm 30 now and have never been strong mentally, i've recently made strides and been taken off my medication. Today I rang a man who does restoration, and wanted to comission him to mend something for my mother, he seems very nice and also professional and sends me an email with the details of his work, his name however instantly throws my mind back to the days of school, turns out he's their older brother. I thought I was mostly over all this school stuff but i've been feeling sick and dizzy ever since, combined with all the other stuff in my life, i'm just not sure I can do it.

edit,  i'm sorry this is a waste of all your time.
