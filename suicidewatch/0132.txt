I think it's about that time.

I think it is about that time. I had my first suicide attempt a few months back while I was seeing a therapist and I'm rather upset I did not go through with it. Today after about 4 weeks of non stop thoughts I think I am almost ready again. Although I am a freshmen in college I don't have a hard time with school work so I don't think it's that. I think it's the fact that I'm finally starting to realize again that no one cares. I remember telling my parents the first time about the story and how broken they were. But the more and more I try and remember how I felt I cant. My feelings have turned into nothing.

I've always just been another number or a stat. And that's what am I'm gonna be this time too. Just a number another college kid that kills themselves. I can't handle the feeling of something constantly eating at my head. When I asked to go see my therapist again she said she'd get back to me with an appointment and I have yet to here anything that was about 3 weeks ago. Someone who gets paid just to talk to me doesn't even think I'm worth it to help? Why should I?

I know I'm privileged and maybe that's the problem. I want someone else in my position I want to be out of this school this state this country this world. I'm getting back into the old ways of not being able to sleep unless I think about ways I'm going to die or at least try. I know I should just end it all. I just don't have the guts and if there's one thing I hate most about myself it's that I'm a coward.
