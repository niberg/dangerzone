Help. I just need someone, anyone...please....

I'm 2 month away from my college application, my life has had it's cringy and bad moments, but it's going well, and it will go well. But right now, in this last 2 month, I've been considering suicide everyday for a number of reason, I just need someone, I know after these 2 months, things will get better, I just don't want myself to do anything stupid when I'm in a different state of mind. I don't want to throw what could potentially be ahead of me away, I just need someone, a message, a reply, anything, thank you.
