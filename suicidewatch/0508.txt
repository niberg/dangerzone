You have to live for the one good day

This is the story of my scar I got about 4 months ago, the knife wasn't sharp enough to cut clear into my vein enough to bleed out, but I tried as hard as I could, the cut is going along the biggest vein I could find, basically it serves a reminder to how shitty life can be at times, and though I tried again multiple times to achieve the same results it never worked out, what I'm trying to get at is, even though life a lot of the time seems hopeless, today, I had a really great day, all I did was wake up, watch some YouTube, browse reddit, went to work, and went home. Definitely nothing special, but just trying as hard as I could to be positive for ONE day, made every single bad day seem like it never happened. You need to live for the days that are worth living, it may seem few out of all the bad days but today I realized, even though I've been depressed for a very long time, there are days worth living for. I'm not saying I'm better all together, or I'll never try it again, but today opened my eyes to the fact that even when you hit rock bottom, it can ALWAYS be worse, you have to find the little things in life to live for. I know its almost impossible to tell yourself to be positive about even the worse things that are happening, but when you find yourself thinking in that state of mind, it builds on itself, I'm sorry for the wall of txt, I just want to help people who are in the situation I was/may be in in the future, sometimes all it takes is someone to say they have made it to other side. If anyone feels like tonight is there night to go, talk to me, I promise I can relate. I'm not saying my life is harder or easier than anyone else's on here, but I've been through some shit and I'm willing to share if you want to share
