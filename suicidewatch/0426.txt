I need help...I have nobody I can talk to.

I don't really know what to say, I really don't want to end my life and I don't know what's stopping me, maybe I'm just afraid to die, maybe I just want to keep going because I know things will change-- for better or for worse. I don't know, but I have nobody to talk to. What compelled me to finally say something here is what happened this morning.

My mom has broken 4 laptops, 1 PC my Xbox And PS3, and now my PS4 controller(easy fix). Nearly $3,500 of electronics, all to stop me from playing games. This may seem ridiculous to feel bad about but games were how I escaped from real life, I haven't been able to play anything for almost 3-4 months now and I'm realizing just how shitty not only my family is but my entire world. Playing games was the only way I could escape from this and forget about it. Now my only way to relieve all the pain and stress is gone and there is nothing I can do about it, I'm 17 and a Junior in Highschool and I really just want to kill myself...I really wish I could just do it. I hate my parents so much, and I just want to leave but I can't. I have friends but I don't want to burden them with any of my problems, I mean that's what I'm here for; I always listen to other people but I never wanted to talk to anyone about my problems, I just don't know anymore...maybe I've lost the will to fight...I don't know what else to say. I'm so depressed and lost and I need help.
