I don't want to live anymore.

I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. If this happens, I want Alex  to know that I have always loved him. I do not understand why things happened the way that they did, and I wish we could be together. I have never been as  happy as when I was with  Alex. And I don’t think I can ever feel that way again. Alex- you are my everything. I don’t know what I did to make you push me away, or not want me around. I have supported your recovery and sobriety, and been your cheerleader since day one. These past 6 months have been the worst of my life. Complete torture no matter what I do. I have tried everything to move forward, and I am stuck. My wish was that we could be together, move on through this rough year, and both grow to be healthier individually and as a couple. I don’t know what you want from me. You said you want me to be happy, but this is simply not possible without you in my life. So, heres hoping I never wake up. Because the pain is too much and I can’t bare it anymore. I love you for ever and always.
