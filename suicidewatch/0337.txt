Please help me find a way (19M)

I feel really cornered. I don't know what to do. I am going to fail my courses at university soon, since I skipped most of my classes and despite trying to catch up it's just frustrating and I can't do it. I finally told my parents the truth about how I feel today, but they got angry, said I'm too young to understand how hard society really is, none of the problems I experience is hard and that if I fail my courses, they will not support me any longer monetarily and I will not be permitted to live with them.

I really don't think I have a way out. I've been consistently bullied before I came to university and I developed pretty severe social anxiety. I don't have a single friend here in university. I've never had anything close to a girlfriend, and I don't remember the last time I've been close to a girl that it doesn't really bother me because having even a normal friend is so difficult for me that having a girlfriend feels entirely out of my reach. If I do fail this year, I will be forced to find a job and being without a degree, and lacking any sort of social skills, I am pretty sure I will eventually become homeless and die in the street one day.

I feel like suicide is the only way out. The fact is, I am scared and alone, and I feel like any other way will be worse than death. I might sound naive but I really need someone to help me and find me a way because right now, my plan in case I flunk my courses is going to be suicide.
