About ready to give up.

I've never asked for much out of life. I just wanted to go to college and get a job that would pay the bills. I just want to have a chance to live an average life. I guess that was too much to hope for...

I graduated college last year after many tense and trying years. A year later and I am almost crippled by a work injury from a crappy job I was forced to take. For six months I've been in agony while unable to work. Worker's Comp has been denied. Short term disability has been denied. I am still technically employed and cannot get food stamps. Family has been helping but I am drowning in bills. Been selling anything that isn't nailed down to keep my head above water but I am tired of fighting.

I'm tired of scraping by and waiting for something to change. I know nothing *is* going to change for me. 

I have no hope, no future, and no chance. Why should I even bother anymore?
