My best friend might kill himself

I don't know what to do.. I'm 17 and he's also 17 and he has been a 3.6 gpa honors student his whole life and dated a really amazing girl for 2.5 years and they broke up about three months ago and I think that is why he is so depressed. 

I knew he was sad but didn't realize it was this bad until he told me he's been thinking about drinking bleach and threatened to shoot himself when his dad tried the "tough love" technique. 

I don't know how to deal with this, i've been trying to convince him that I seriously couldn't handle him not being in my life anymore, he is my second half and I have known him since i was 3, 14 years of my life he has always been here for me and now I can't be there for him.

He is failing every single one of his classes (we go to a community college through Running Start at our high school) so not only is he ruining his high school grades, but also his college transcript. He has zero drive to fix his grades and he doesn't care about his future anymore. He wants to drop out of high school and it's tearing me apart because I know how he feels and I want to show him that he can make it through it but he wont listen, he is 100% convinced that he will never again have the drive to do anything..

His mom set up a meeting with a therapist but he skipped because it "wouldn't help". What can I do? He's my best friend... Please help me.
