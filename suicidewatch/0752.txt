No sign of life from him in two weeks. Did he kill himself? I'm devastated, help!

What can I do? Is there any hope he's still alive? I'm going crazy!

He's the best man ever, I love him so much, things seemed pretty good when we got together. Until he started withdrawing. He told me about his depression, how he doesn't see a point in living any more. 

I didn't know how to react. Alternately tried to leave him alone and keep the contact. It seemed like he didn't want to end it, but he seemed paralyzed by depression. 

Now I can't get in contact with him any more. I'm terrified, afraid he might have commited suicide. Whatever happened or didn't happen, things are really, really bad. 

Any idea what I can do? I tried to get into contact with him, tried to contact his brother, but there's never an answer. 

Btw, we live 400 kilometers apart, which doesn't make it easier.
