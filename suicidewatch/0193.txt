I can't tell if it's real or not anymore..

I have this thing for months now. Everything seems to be real, yet, at the same time, imaginary. I have no clue, I can't tell if events are really, I can't tell if the clothes I wear are real. Hell, I can't even tell if I've really had the conversations I remember. There's things I can't remember, I have no track of time any more. It's very frustrating. I ofte think of doing something to myself, or jump of a building, just so that it can be over or so that I would wake up from this horrible dream. Everyday I wonder if this is real or just a dream. Every single day. I also think that I have feelings for somebody, but again, I can't tell if she is real or not, if I'm just imagining her. It makes me miserable, it makes me want to kill myself, hurt myself just to be able to tell what is going on. I don't recognise myself in the mirror,  it's just another person. I Just want all of this to be over, and get some rest on my mind. I am so lost in what I should do, I have no idea where to go and the idea of just leaving this world is so attractive.
