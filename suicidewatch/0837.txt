I don't know why I haven't killed myself yet (16)

My life is meaningless, happiness for me is sparse.    

I'm not sure if I'm going to commit suicide, I tried to twice before, but gave up at the very last second.    

Nobody knows I'm suicidal, I gave hints to my mother but she lectured me on how suicidal people are selfish scumbags, thanks mom you fucking retard. 

My dad figured out, but he just told me I'd be a "lost soul" if I killed myself, that would almost be helpful if I wasn't an atheist.   

I have "friends", but I don't have anyone that I "connect" with, my "friends" are more video game partners, that's it, we rarely speak outside of after school gaming sprees.            

They all like electronic, I like extreme metal. They're charismatic party goers, I'm depressed and slightly misanthropic (I can't stand place like Imgur due to sheer amount of positivity there, it makes me sick in a very sick way), they're normal and I strive not to be normal. 

Edit: I suppose I should also point out that I'm also transgendered, I'm not self hating, but I sure as hell don't like my own body. If I fell into boiling hot water and got scars all of my body, I wouldn't care, my body is a piece of shit that only serves to hold my mind and complete tasks, it's not a temple, it's not something I care about, it's a rusty robot straight out of a trash yard.

Sigh... can someone just talk to me, please?
