The only reason I'm alive is because I'm afraid to fail

Well maybe more than failure. I'm also afraid of pain. Nor do I want to end up a vegetable or lie on my floor for 7 days as I slowly twitch and die.   I've done some research, and a shotgun blast to the base of the neck is 99.9% fatal but I can't reach the fucking trigger because the shotgun is too long.. What if I miss?
