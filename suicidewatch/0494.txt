No more tolerance for pain

So, since i was 17, it's always been made clear that my body was dying, and that there was little to be done. i have accepted that, and I have done the best I could everyday.
I have reached the point with this disease where I just feel like I am not capable of getting up and dealing with another day of feeling my body dying around me.
I am sick of pain, the pain killers the hospitals use haven't worked in weeks, I've lost 10 kg in 15 days and I am simply exhausted.

I knew this day would eventually come.
I just need an excuse to hang on for one more day.
I need hope that even if they can't cure this genetic disease, that it is at least worth trying for one more day.

edit: sounded like an whining git
