I don't know how to cope

I think I've finally hit my limit. I lost my boyfriend to a drug overdose a week ago and I honestly don't think I can handle this level of pain. It's unbearable and I don't think I can handle this any longer. I just want to be with him again and not have to feel this anymore. Everyone keeps saying that it will get better but even better would be miserable.  We were looking at engagement rings and he was the only person who I've ever loved to this extent. He was everything and I can't do this without him. 

Only reason I'm even posting is so there's a link in my phone after I'm gone to explain  to my family why I did it
