I fucked everything up.

I have been depressed for over a year now. Last October, I lost my mother to breast cancer. It was the worst year of my life. Over time I grew more and more depressed. Until I met my (former) best friend. She and I grew really close. We would call eachother and stay up all night trying to help eachother with our problems, or just make eachother laugh. This all changed after the anniversary of my moms death. Before this I was already suicidal and she knew this and tried everything she could to help me. But I started to threaten suicide almost everyday. She couldn't take it so she left me. She can't even talk to me anymore. It's soul crushing to see her walk down the hallway and completely ignore me. I fucked it all up. I just wish I can make her life better once I end everything.
