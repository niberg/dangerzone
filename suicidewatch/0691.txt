Felt like I couldn't take a single second more last night.

Hi everyone,

just wanted to share with you what happened last night, maybe It can help even one person.

So I've been through a lot.. soul crushing experiences and feel like I hit rock bottom almost every week now. Last night I was awake and i was crying (not sure if anyone else gets this, but when I really do feel like ending it I get this strange feeling in my veins.. like butterflies) so I put some shoes on and went outside. 
I stared up into the sky with all the stars which I realized I haven't done in years and it struck me, how everything we think matters doesn't matter at all. What we are taught that matters, is only another persons idea.. nothing more. It took the edge of for me, that pain that hurts so much you want it over faded. It made me look at life as a game, nothing to get worried about. I still feel depressed, but I don't feel suicidal when I realize what I said. 

Just another quick note, I noticed foods can amplify depression. I recently did raw diet (I got bitten by a deer tick and got Lyme disease, was willing to try anything) and realized that black cloud that seems to follow me everywhere was so much smaller than usual. I always thought I am f**king depressed because of my life, what has happened etc but food really does amplify those feelings from what I found. Try it for a week if you're feeling hopeless, not much to lose if you feel suicidal.
