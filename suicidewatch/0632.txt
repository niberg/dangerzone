A neurological condition practically guarantees I'll be alone and depressed until I die. Is it really so wrong to want to speed up that process?

Thanks to my defective autistic brain, I think wrong, I feel wrong, and I express myself wrong. There's no cure. No treatment. I'll be like this for my entire life. A burden on the few people I don't push away. Financial, social, and psychological dead weight.

In the last 24 hours, I've held my sharpest kitchen knife to my wrist 3 times. Each time, I thought "you're so close, just a quick flash of pain, and then it'll all be over". I don't know how many more times I can put the knife away.

Is it really wrong to want to bring an end to this pathetic excuse of a life?
