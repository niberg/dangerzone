I'm pretty fuckin' close

Not even sure how to start this, but the title kind of explains it all.

I know  that I'm a terrible person. 

My family has always been there for me, yet I find it so difficult to even call them and talk to them for even a little bit.

I feel tremendous guilt every single day of my life, even though I live a life which should be admired and prideful of.

Selfish would be the best way to describe it.

I fucking hate myself and, as the title states, I'm pretty, no, very fucking close.

I'm so sorry.
