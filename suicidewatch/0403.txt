I feel so worthless

basically what the title says. No matter what I do I just can't do anything right. I'm always fucking something up, whether it's a home, school, work, it doesn't matter no matter how hard I try. I always wake up, go to school, and go to work feeling like complete trash.  Everybody I know has better grades, better friends, better sex life and a better family. I'm failing my classes, have no real friends, had to see a prostitute, just to lose my virginity, and live in a loveless household. everything i've done to try to better myself has only ended in failure.  What do I do?
