Why do I end up here?

Over the past month, I keep turning to thoughts and fantasies of suicide.  Unbeknownst to him, a friend has talked me down, every single time.  Tonight is a perfect example.  I have plans in two hours to go sit in my car in my garage, and let physics do the rest.  Yet now, I don't want to live, but I don't have a strong urge to go forward with my plans either.  

But I arrive here, with these thoughts, week after week.  Why shouldn't I just do it?  Coming back here is painful enough...
