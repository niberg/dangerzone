I'm done

I lost my hope. I feel destroyed as I write. Life *seems* great. Just seems, but isn't. I'm only Fourteen, and I feel there's no need to go. Failed in love, and I have to see she with another guy. This just wrecks me. Also, no one seems to understand me. No one hears me. I can't also hang out with friends, because they were stupid enough to bring alcohol to my birthday party, and my parents now hate them. I just want to have fun and be loved, but I have given up. I guess.
