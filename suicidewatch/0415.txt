I've decided to go through with it.

I don't know when. It may not even be for a few years but can also be tomorrow. I just know I'm going to one day, its already been decided. Method has been chosen as well. I just need help figuring out what to do before I actually do it. There is no reason not to, I've sat down and thought about this already, there's nothing that can stop Me to be honest.
