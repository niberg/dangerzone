I need advice

One of my friends is really worrying me. He mentions suicide a lot and ties to pass it off as a joke but it is mentioned much too often to ignore. He claims to be "passively suicidal" and I don't know what to do. I've told him I'm there for him. Is there any advice you guys can give to help me help him?
