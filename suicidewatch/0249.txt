My husband is leaving me and it's my fault. I can't see how to go on.

He ignores me and ignores me until I can't take it anymore and lose my temper, I told him to leave and he wouldn't, I tried to make him but he's stronger than me. He says I crossed a line and there is no going back. I can barely breathe I can't imagine going on like this. I am going to hide his handgun and save it until I can't take it anymore.
