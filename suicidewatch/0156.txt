There is no good in life

There just isn't.  There is nothing I enjoy on this planet that I can do consistently.  

I'm 22 and have never had a girlfriend.  I don't even know how to talk to girls let alone ask one on a date.  As a result I haven't had much sex, at all.  The only time I got laid was by an escort and I paid for that shit.

Women don't give a fuck about me.  They have never shown a shred of interest.  If one would meet me half way or something, that's all I'm asking for. 

There was this girl that I thought was real cool, a friend of a friend.  Pretty.  A lot of similar interests to me.  Friendly.  But I find out today she just got a new boyfriend.    

I see all these people post pictures of enjoying each other's company, guys with a girl in each arm.  Hot girls that want nothing to do with me.  It fucking sucks. 

Work sucks.  I just got off a 15 hour shift of constant work, no breaks what so ever.  I literally woke up, went to work, then I'm going to bed in a bit here.  

Parents are distant to me, as well as my brother.  I have no real friends to speak of.  I don't know how to make friends either.  

There is no good in life.  Nothing I look forward to.  It's just me in this cold lonely world.
