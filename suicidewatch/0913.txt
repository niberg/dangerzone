I was supposed to kill myself today.

Today was supposed to be the day. Well, actually, today was the day I was going to propose to the love of my life. It was going to be the happiest day of our lives to this point. But whatever, things change, people change. I've accepted the fact that that's done. Over time, this became the day I settled on to end it all. Unfortunately, over the last few months I got some false hope in my life. Now the false hope is gone and the day is here, but my plans are gone. I mean, I can very easily kill myself today. In fact, I want to. But this has become something that I need to plan like a ritual. Which is funny because I'm such an impulsive person. Ugh. Fuck this day. Fuck Halloween. Fuck her. Fuck all of this. I've got it all planned. I only have a few months left. But today is going to be such a long day. The only thing on my mind is what could have been today. What a great day it could have been. In more ways than one. But I guess now all I can think about is the days going by and finally getting to the day where I will find peace with it all. And that day can not come soon enough.
