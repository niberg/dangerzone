i need help.

I just need someone to listen. I don't know what's going on and I'm very close to taking my life. I know that's not the best action to take but I feel so hopeless, and so helpless right now. I started dental school in august, but am not doing nearly as well as I wish I was. My boyfriends basically told my parents to fuck off, my parents think my boyfriend is a loser, and my sister sold me out to her friends and now everybody thinks that I'm a bitch. I've really had it with life. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but at the same time I really hope I just don't wake up tomorrow. I don't want to deal with this anymore.
