Alone.

Im 17 and used to live a happy life. I decided to switch to homeschooling after dreading school everyday, it was awful for me I have a hard time explaining it. My dad committed suicide a little over a year ago and ever since I haven't been the same person. I used to live a kind of happy life but now I feel alone. I feel the few friends I do have arent real friends they just act because we work together and want to make things easy. Im pathetic, im going no where in life my mom the only family I have left after the rest treated me like shit has ignored me since Tuesday and wont even look at me. I have a belt next to me and feel like hanging myself like my dad did.

I wasnt always anti social. But I really dont want to continue anymore, Ive tried everything to be happy. I moved to a better place bought myself lots of nice things but nothing gets passed depression and loneliness.
