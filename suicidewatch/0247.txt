Everything was going so well...

I have been depressed since the 10th grade. You never would have been able to guess it, even now. I am personable, and love jokes and conversation. If I told this to one of my friends they would never believe me. Not getting into college and being lonely took a big toll on me. But I did it. I fought through. I made it too college, and am doing well. I found a girl I enjoy spending time with. I have been doing well at my job. Overall I have been well. The pit in my chest is always there but I have learned to help it go away. Skip to last Saturday. I had a great night with my friends drinking and partying. I wasn't thinking straight and decided to go home. Less than a Fucking mile. I get  pulled over. Cited for DUI. The feeling hasn't left my chest since. I can't breathe. I can't sleep. I only told my best friend. I am so afraid about telling my mom. She is going to kick me out for sure. I have a 29 mile one way commute everyday. This is it. I don't see recovery from this. With all the fines and bills I can't afford school. My mom won't help me after this. Does anyone have experience with this? I just can't stand to feel like this anymore.. I feel like I'm being crushed. I have thought about suicide for years. Almost did once before and stopped myself but it wouldn't be the same this time.. I'm sorry for rambling but I just wanted everyone to know the full story and my side of things. Thanks for reading.
