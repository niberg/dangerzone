It's real this time. I've thought through all of my options and this is all I have.

It's time for me to go.

My life has been an awful downward spiral for several years and its gotten to the point where it's never going to get any better. I'm miserable. I have no quality of life. No sense of self preservation. 

I've been literally begging my family for help, for about a year now. I've told them about my depression, how crippling it is, and how I can't function anymore. They tell me I have to figure things out on my own and to stop trying to talk to them. I'm all alone. I've been dying for a long time.

I haven't spoken to any friends in months. As far as I'm concerned, I no longer have any. I do nothing with my days. Literally nothing. No job, no car, no friends. I'm living with my SO but we haven't been real for a long time. 

Death scared me for a while. It doesn't now. It's time for me to go. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to. I have no one. I have nothing.

I'm not going to leave a note, or anything. I'm just waiting until I'm alone. Tonight, tomorrow, or Monday. 

I can't stand being conscious anymore. Every second of every minute is just pain.
