Trapped in this bubble.

I've dealt with depression for over a decade of my life. Endless trial of treatments left me with no real success. It grows very tiring and upsetting that I will probably never be able to represent myself like the great person I know in my in my head. Because of this ‘thing’ I have a hard time being able to keep stable relationships in my life. I am always left with endless guilt for my thoughts and my actions.

It’s difficult to open up about this because, well, it’s negative, counterproductive and it puts me in a vulnerable position. I try to represent myself as who I want to be, more than how I am to get things done. There’s a line to how much you can repress and shove down, it will always be there inside of me.

I feel so lonely inside my head and I constantly seek out things to express and connect with, just to feel a little less depressed. But it isn’t an easy fix, which leads me to chain smoking all day and anything to give myself this numbing effect to still be present but not here all at the same time.

I’ve been pretty good with keeping it all in, but recently I have been unable to do that and it has been turning great people away from me. I am also living quite destructively. 

I really want to just leave, I don't want to be here.
