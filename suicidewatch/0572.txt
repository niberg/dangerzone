I think I'm doing it tonight.

I've took strattera a year and a half ago and trazodone 6 months ago. Both of these medications have ruined my life. I have severe withdrawal symptoms and I can't function. I'm 21 years old and have only completed a year in college. After my first year I dropped out and every time I try to take classes I just fail. I can't do anything. I usually sit in my room all day because I sleep 3 hours a night and I can't function at all. I'm done with this. Psychotropic drugs ruined my life. I guess I'm in the minority of people that have severe reactions to quitting these drugs. Going back on isnt an option I've tried and I just feel worse. I already tried suicide once but this time is it. I'm just going to hang myself.
