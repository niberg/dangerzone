i am afraid

i am not going to kill myself, not right now anyway, it's mostly just a fantasy i think, so maybe this post doesn't belong here, but i don't know where else to put it.

i get so sad, i don't know why. i know there is something wrong with me, i know i need help, but i am too afraid to seek it. i have suffered from social anxiety all my life, i am scared to talk to people, i would be petrified to talk to anyone about this stuff, i just can't do it. i'm such a coward. but this isn't even the problem, i can handle it, i have found ways to cope, but now how do i get help for feeling depressed? sometimes i think i am bipolar but i don't know. i could never talk to my family about it or anyone i know in real life, i can't talk to them about anything. i can only post here because it's anonymous, i get paranoid, i am connecting through a VPN to post this so it can't be easily linked back to me.

i am 25 and i have only had one girlfriend. we were together for nearly 5 years and then it ended a while ago. i get so jealous it's not normal, it keeps me up at night, the emotions are hard to deal with. i was never cut out for love, i just want a simple life, but now i don't know how to undo everything and remove the feelings.

i am doing well at university, i am in my final year now with high grades, but i am scared i will throw it all away. i feel self destructive.

sometimes i just wish i had someone i could talk to.

i don't know. this message is so stupid, i am sorry for wasting your time. i don't know what to do.
