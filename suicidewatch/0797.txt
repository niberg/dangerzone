I want to end it knowing all that I've missed out on

Barely graduated high school, failed out of community college multiple times. Now I'm here. I'm 21 and I have no motivation. I'm not happy and I never have been for as long as I can remember. I work full-time and am taking one prerequisite class at my local community college so that I can take my networking class. and then do what with my CCNA? walk around like a continued nobody? I should be a junior at a 4 year university somewhere having time of my life living the college experience. I've experienced none of that. I'm a failure. I'm not capable of what I desire to do most. I don't have any friends and I don't see the point in doing anything in this world. I'm a failure and always have been, I don't have any motivation and I just want everything to stop. The emotional pain is so bad... and it hurts so much. I'm not sure how I'm going to handle myself.
