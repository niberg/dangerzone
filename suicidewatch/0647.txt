Everyone just lies

Its been 8 years, 8 god damn years and I'm not getting better. I keep fucking trying over and over again and I can't even function, I can't stay in school, I'm just becoming the disappointment I know I am, that I am inevitably drawn towards. I don't know why I'm posting here, I guess I have a little bit of hope, but its so close to fading away. Once that's gone I have nothing left, I'm done.
