Strangeness

I am 27 I've done a lot in my life but right now I'm in a low period. My mother committed suicide when I was 12 so I know all the pain it causes but I'm jobless broke and soon to be evicted. Now there is a next step I have a friend who would help me out but since I have now been charged with a felony the struggle is going to be even harder. I've started from nothing twice and I'm just tired. I would like to just disappear and not burden my family with costs. So I'm torn I can't get to my friend and I can't stay here. And I'm sure as hell not going to prison. Normally I could plan out these things and set goals but the drive is gone
