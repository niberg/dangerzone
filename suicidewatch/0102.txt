I don't want to anymore. Why do I even try?

This semester started out great... I was happy, I was keeping ahead of things. Then I started to lose interest (as always.)

Started to put things off like I always do. But things were still going okay.. I was making a new friend for the first time since like.. ever.

This classmate and I are in a coding contest together (due in January.) I was really excited because I figured she would keep me interested in this contest and I would stay motivated (adhd == hard to stay motivated/follow through with things.)

Anyway, a few weeks ago she started being really distant, and kind of bitchy. I don't know why...maybe she's busy, maybe something happened in her life, maybe I did something wrong.

In any case, I feel like complete shit.... she just got mad at me because I keep changing my mind on stuff (mood swings yo.)

And now the feelings of suicide that have been coming back for the past month are hitting me HARD. I just don't want to go to class tomorrow... I don't want to be alive tomorrow... I want to die....badly.

I'm not on any meds or even caffeine that would make me feel this way.. I'm just fucked up and hate myself.

I hate my ADHD. I can't seem to complete anything unless it takes 5 minutes or less. I hate it all. I hate the world. I hate myself.

edit:

I also feel like shit because I'm looking to her for motivation which I know is a bad idea and never works out, and even if she were to try to help it would be too draining on her and she would still eventually end up being distant (as would anyone.)

I went into this semester knowing I need to put on a personality of being confident and happy all the time. I'm failing at that, and it looks like the one friend I might have been making is being driven away by it.

Edit2:

I've calmed down... But everything in the post is still true.
