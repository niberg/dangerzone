I really hate my life

I have had a really hard time in Canada since I left Barbados its been really hard for me I came here when I was five and I have had the shit end of the stick my mum treated me like dirt and didn't stick up like a mum should. I've been bullied for most of life expect for grade 11&amp;12 for my accent I still have my accent after all these years. I've been put in the hospital for depression and attempted suicide twice but the mental health  here in Canada doesn't give a shit the doctors have done horrible things to me like give like test meds on me and god I don't want to talk about those days. 

I some how got out of high school l this summer and I got into a school to make video games but I have autism and learning is hard for me very hard and cause my grades are low even thought i really tried they suspended me from the course and my only way back in is to write a petition to a higher up in the school and its not  100% that this Petition will work. 

This just one of many shitty things I've had in my life I always seem to get the shit end of the stick I really fucking hate my life what is the point? Really whats the point all my life shitty things happen to me.
