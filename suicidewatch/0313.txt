Time to sleep.

Well reddit, I've finally decided I'm done with this shit hole I call a life. I've taken every pill in my medicine cabinet and now I'm just going to go to bed and hope  I don't wake up. It was a shitty 18 years leading up to this point. Parents divorce at 8, all my friends leave me at 10, and become a stoner at 14. I guess I just set myself up for failure. My mother doesn't give a shit about me anymore. My step dad is a little bald cunt-fucker piece of shit, and my sister made it very clear that I'm a failure and always will be. Goodbye reddit.

Edit: This is stupid. I don't know why I made this. 

Edit again: So I think I'm going to go to the hospital. I'm sorry, I just worried a bunch of people for no reason. I suck.

Last edit: I told my mom, she's pissed, poison control is pissed, cops are pissed, I'm running. Running and vomitting 

Last lats edit: Thank you guys for talking me into going to the hospital. As I type I'm in the back of my car heading into Portland. My sister insisted on coming, my step dad, is here next to me, and my mom is driving me. You guys helped me see people still care. Thank you so much, I'm crying and so sad but so happy because I can continue my life. 8
I get to turn 18 in two weeks and I get to go to college. This subreddit is beautful, thank you.
