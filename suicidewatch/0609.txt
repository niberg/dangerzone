"Best years of your life!" my ass. I'm not happy in college, I'm not happy at home, and don't know what to do.

Being here is misanthropy inducing. I hate it here. I hate the environment. I hate the people. It feels exactly like high school only everyone is drunk. I feel like I don't belong here, at home, anywhere. It's really awful. Even on meds, which usually help, I still don't feel right here. I want to leave, but if I do, I know I will end up killing myself because I will just be burden on my already aging father. I just don't know what to do. It's not "Making Friends" thing, I prefer to be alone, but I feel like everyone is out having fun and I'm just not a part of the community. I just don't know where to turn.
