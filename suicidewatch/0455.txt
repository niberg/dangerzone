i live right next to a train station. it would be so easy to get up and stand there and get erased instead of going to school. i don't know why i haven't done it yet, honestly. i've gotten the "help". i've taken the meds. people have inspected me. i don't need my parents giving me shit about how i avoid eating. i don't need people telling me they are there to help. i don't need the stress from school. i dont need people to tell me it will get better. i don't need friends telling me they understand. i don't need to wait for the future. i don't have anything to look forward to... i wanted to be an astronaut once, but i would be an idiot if i actually thought that would happen. i need to leave.
nobody asked me for permission to bring me here, and i don't need anybody's permission to leave.
