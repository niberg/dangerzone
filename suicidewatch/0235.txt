Life doesn't mean shit to me.

I'm 16 and I fucking hate life. I feel like a complete freak because I'm attracted to girls much younger than me. I always have been, but it never bothered me until July when my friend jokingly called me a pedophile. I'm so afraid of growing up to be a creepy 40 year old man. Ever since I started to freak out over liking younger girls, my whole life has gone downhill. I have never been attracted to my sister, but recently I have to *tell* myself I'm not. Maybe it's just me freaking out, but I just want to stop. Awful stuff like rape and murder doesn't bother me anymore because life just seems so worthless to me. Without all that awful stuff, humans wouldn't be where we are today anyway. I feel like such a psycho. I really don't think I'm a rapist, though. I feel like we're constantly told what is normal and what isn't. I'm obviously not normal, so what am I supposed to do? Just live the rest of my life being a freak? I'm still attracted to girls my age and older, but this is starting to consume me. School certainly doesn't help. I feel like a fucking drone, doing the same shit every single day. It'll only get worse when I'm an adult. If I could just get hit by a car or something that'd be great. I can't live like this anymore. I started seeing a psychiatrist not too long ago, and I've met with them twice so far. I've only started to feel worse over time and I don't see my outlook on life suddenly changing anytime soon.  
  
EDIT: Please don't disregard this because I'm an idiot 16 year old. I know.
