I guess this is it

I've not long came out of hospital, 3 days to be exact - but I just feel constantly down, like I've let my family and everybody around me down. I realise now that I really shouldn't have, but I overdosed. I don't plan on calling an ambulance or anything, I'm just going to wait it out. I know about 20k milligrams of paracetamol is toxic, but at this point I don't care. I just wanted to say thankyou for the support you guys have given me over the months &lt;3
