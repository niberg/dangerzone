I don't want to die, I just want it to stop

I don't understand why I fell the way I do. I have a relatively good job. I have a great family (who are the main reason why I can never see actually doing anything to myself.) I have an OK social life. But I just really, honestly dislike myself. Down to my core, I dislike everything about me. I'm fat, yet time and again I self sabotage myself from making any real changes. I am lazy, gluttonous and have an addictive personality. I'm probably a developing alcoholic, but it makes me feel more intensely, so I like it. Plus, it gives me some kind of identity. I may not be very interesting, or have any thing interesting to talk about, but at least I can talk about drinking. 

I just don't understand myself. I place an obscene amount of importance on being in a relationship, when I have never been in one. I've never really kissed a girl, except one horrible experience in middle school. I have almost no physical contact with other people in my life. I have no idea what its like to be in a relationship with another person outside of a casual friendship. And yet, I feel like I have to have that to be a successful person. 

I feel like I'm wasting my youth. I'm 22, yet I am storing my money away, looking for the most efficient apartment to rent, got an economically sound car, and am just a general stick in the mud. I'm unadventurous. I'm a terribly boring person. Some days I just can't fathom a reason to go on, outside of the fact that if I just laid in bed all day, I would be a disappointment to my family.

 I have a massive debt from college hanging over my head, I have 0 romantic possibilities, and in general am just a fat, lazy piece of shit.

I am not going to hurt myself, so please don't waste any time on me. I just felt the need to throw something about my self loathing out into the void. Other people here need your help more than me.
