I'm 42, Depressed, Fired &amp; Just Had Enough

42, Tired &amp; Sacked- Suicide Seems Inevitable &amp; Preferable (self.needadvice)

What can I say? I write this just to put my thoughts in order.
I lost my job yesterday after 18m of harassment and bullying. I have a case for tribunal but that would take a year.
This has brought matters to a head. I have been depressed since Mother died after a long, painful illness. The problems at work only worsened them.
I liked my job very much, but some people in it were frankly horrible types who loved picking on others.
Now I sit and look at the future and realise I don't want to be part of it. I have no immediate family, no relationship (by choice), I have friends but they are not enough and none live very close by.
The thought of starting again is too much- working another job after 6 years there, dealing with people again. Another office, another system.
Recently events happened that brought closure to old areas of my life. Now I feel I just want to leave. I just want to go to sleep and never awaken.
All I want now is to be left alone. My Mother was my emotional all and nothing else compares.
I kept some of her medication and liquid morphine. I am trying to buy Nembutal online but if unsuccessful will fall back on what I have.
I no longer have either interest or energy in continuing. My happy times are behind me. I truly dread another 20, 40, whatever years here.
My decision to end it all feels very rational.
I'm sitting in bed in the dark writing this, surrounded by my books and belongings and just want to die here, in a warm and happy place.
