And now I have nothing

I'm 24 with a life long disease that will one day kill me, low testosterone that I can't treat, have only talked to 1 female in the last 4 years (a friend) and now she has left me too.


Been my best friend for years, I told her everything. But then I smothered her by being needy. She told me 2 weeks ago she wanted a break, but we could still talk. She never reached out so yesterday I did asking for clarification about the break. She never responded. She is done with me and now I have nothing.


I always get too attached to anyone who comes into my life, but this is the first time it has happened to a friend, and cause them to leave by being needy. Probably because I hate myself and I thrive on the ups they give me and without them I'm worthless. 


When I would tell her about ending my life she said don't, that I wouldn't do that to her. Well now I don't even have her to worry about. She wants nothing to do with me.
