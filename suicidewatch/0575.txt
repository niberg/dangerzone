A million medium things.

I hate feeling like this. I hate that what I feel is invalidated by the too complex to explain, million minute things that have accompanied me here. You can't explain it, because you don't fully understand it yourself.
No single snowflake is responsible for an avalanche, man. 

Sorry for rambling.
