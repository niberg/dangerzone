Well, I got my noose ready. It's been shitty, but at least it's over.

Maybe why I'm posting this is I just want to reflect for a moment. I had a pretty shitty life so far, always alone with a few friends here and there. I was bullied as a kid, and that combined with me being sensitive maybe the biggest reason why my life turned out like it did. 

Bullying is a problem. But I'd say this noose is a good solution in my case. 

It's better than drowning, drowning is probably one of my biggest fears. That and heights. Which is why I can't really drown myself or jump. Fuck that. 

I reached out here a couple weeks ago, maybe because that post was a vent (and this sort of is too) no one here really gave a shit either. I've reached and reached all over but no one has cared. So I'd say it's about time I say goodbye. 

I lastly just want to say that suicide isn't the only solution to problems, and you shouldn't be like me.

Never was good with goodbyes, so I guess see you on the other side.
