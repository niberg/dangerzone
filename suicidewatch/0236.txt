I'm afraid I've found that final straw.

I've been battling suicidal thoughts since August of 2009.  That's when my Dad took his life.  I'm an only child and never got the chance to truly greive since I was slung into being the man of the house and had to be strong.  6 months ago, I started reaching out for help due to the massive swings in depression around the times of his birthday and the day that he passed (approx. 6 months apart).  I went to a counselor who seemed distracted and more worried about what time she was leaving than listening to me.  She was truly a waste of time.  I talked to my general prac. at the same time and was prescribed an antidepressant to help.  It did.  I don't really have any close friends anymore because I moved away from home after college and left all of my friends behind.  I've been here 2 years and have a few acquaintances, but no true friends.  I still talk to my mom and her parents, but that's about it as far as family goes.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who truly is the light of my life and I really think the reason I've made it this far is because of her.  Well, I made a huge mistake and I've really pissed her off enough that she just walked out on me.  She says she's completely done and although I'm not truly drooping back into suicidal thoughts quite yet...I know it's coming.   I may have just lost the one thing keeping me fighting and I'm scared.  No. I'm terrified of what's coming.  I don't know what to do and I'm seriously just sitting here waiting on those thoughts to start creeping in and start overwhelming me.  She's gone and I really have no one to talk to/confide in.  I've never posted here, nor have I really read these posts so I don't really know  if what I'm saying makes sense or if this is the right place.  I don't know what I need right now, but I'm holding back the tears writing this and I'm scared that the next step is holding something to my head before long.  Can anyone relate? Please.
