Pain can't maintain.

I'm 21 an I'm stressed to the max. My girl of 2 years left me an my mom recently passed. I'm surprisingly calm about committing suicide maybe b/c I know it will end the pain. Really thinking about buying a shotgun from academy tomorrow and ending it. Maybe I just need somebody to tell me all the right things to help talk me out. Idk I'm feeling really numb and disconnected to this world.
